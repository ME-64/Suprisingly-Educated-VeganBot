where do you get your protein?,"Getting enough protein is not actually as hard as people will make you think. What people don’t realise is that protein is in virtually everything we eat! Plus most adults need only about 50g a day but consume considerably more than this.
Great vegan sources of protein include, tofu, tempeh, seitan, lentils, chickpeas, beans, nuts and seeds.
"
Are free range eggs bad?,"Most free range laying hens live in crowded sheds. Their outside area is generally restricted to a small enclosure with access via small exit holes which many hens are unable to reach and therefore have no outside access. The ones who do go outside are sometime trapped outside to be picked off by foxes. Hens can have a lifespan of 10 years, however they are often killed after 18 months when their productivity drops. Free range laying hens are the offspring of parent birds who are kept for their entire lives inside crowded, filthy sheds with no access to the outside. The hens and roosters are housed together for constant mating. The hens have no escape or respite from the roosters, their backs become featherless, red and sore from when roosters mount them. The female chicks of these parent birds are sent to free range, barn laid or caged sheds. The males are unwanted by-products and are killed soon after hatching, generally by being ground up alive in a macerator."
Can you still eat fish?,"I don’t want to state the obvious but… fish aren’t vegetables! Even though they are very different from us, they are still living and breathing sentient beings who experience suffering and pain, and they are not food."
Don't cows need to be milked though?,"A cow only needs to be milked because she had her calf taken away from her within a day or two of birth. The calf gets a cheap replacement formula generally made from slaughterhouse plasma and vitamins. Perhaps this strikes you as an unfair deal all the way around. And in a few months, after the cow’s milk yields peak, she’ll be re-impregnated once again to start the whole cycle all over. For more details, check out our page on dairy cows.

All in all, it’s a terrible life for these animals, especially the cows who live on “dry lot” dairies who are confined in crowded sheds. Disease is common, especially mastitis—an infection of the udders brought on by the enormous milk yields of modern-day dairy cows.

Luckily, it’s never been easier to go dairy-free. Excellent vegan versions of traditional dairy products are abundant and easy to find. Most groceries today carry soy, rice, and almond milk. And you can find excellent vegan cheese and ice cream at any natural foods store, and in better supermarkets. It’s also easy to find non-dairy yogurts, margarine, and even coffee creamer. Look for all these products in the dairy case."
Do animals suffer?,"Animals have the same evolutionary past as us and the same reporting mechanisms for pain that we do; a brain and central nervous system. They also produce the same reactions in scenarios where pain would arise; they flinch and make noises of distress. There’s strong evidence too that animals experience mental suffering. In stressful situations vertebrates have been found to release adrenally-derived glucocorticoid hormones which “drive gluconeogenesis, suppress reproductive processes, alter movement and feeding rates, impact immune functions, and generally help an individual enter a ‘state of emergency’ when an environmental stressor induces their release”. Fish too, for example, “experience a rise in cortisol” (commonly known as the stress hormone) when confronted with factors capable of producing fear. There is even evidence that animals can experience mental illnesses just as we do."
Do plants suffer?,"Plants have input and output reactions to certain stimulation, for example photosynthesis, but they can’t experience pain or mental suffering due to not having a brain or central nervous system. Being vegan actually reduces the number of plants eaten because the animals we eat have to be fed on vast quantities of plants. Producing a kilogram of beef requires 25 kilograms of grain, one kilogram of pork requires nine kilograms of grain and one kilogram of chicken requires three kilograms of grain. This is also why the argument that eating meat is better than being vegan because more insects and small animals are killed in plant agriculture does not hold."
"Does producing milk, cheese and eggs cause suffering?","These processes indeed cause great suffering to animals. Mother cows need to be pregnant to produce milk so from 15 months old they are forced into confined spaces every two or three months and artificially impregnated. After birth, the calf is removed from the mother within 36 hours; if the calf is male, he will likely be sold to be raised for veal or if there isn’t enough demand, he will be shot. The Drum reported in 2012 that 90,000 male calves are shot dead each year for this reason. If the calf is female, she will often be prepared to be a mother calf.Normally, a cow holds at most two litres of milk in her udder but the antibiotics farmers use for optimum milk production cause cows to carry 20 litres at any one time. The weight of this often makes cows lame or causes painful inflammation of the mammary glands (mastitis). Cows naturally live for up to 25 years but after 5 years of producing milk in these conditions their yield will no longer be profitable and they are slaughtered. In egg production, whether free range or not, hens have their beak painfully trimmed to prevent them injuring other hens due to the stress of confinement. They also experience a pre-mature death at around 80 weeks, when their natural life span is up to 8 years. Caged hens never see daylight and are restricted to space only slightly larger than a sheet of A4 paper. Male chicks are an unnecessary by-product of this process and are killed straight after hatching by incineration or gassing.   "
Does vegan food taste good?,"Yes it does! Our culture is all that limits us in eating an amazing selection of delicious vegan foods. We are increasingly programmed to eat highly processed and animal based diets. It is so much easier these days with plenty of vegan products and recipes available, and more coming into the market all the time"
Don’t we need some animal products in our diet to be healthy?,"For those who might be concerned about meeting all their nutritional requirements with just plant foods, rest assured that even the mainstream and conservative Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the American Dietetic Association, and described by www.eatright.org as “the world’s largest organization of food and nutrition professionals”) confirms that you do not need to eat animal products to maintain your health.

“It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life-cycle including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood and adolescence and for athletes.

Many people who become vegan report that their health greatly improves as a result. Perhaps, the lighter, healthier body that emerges with veganism is a reflection of a lighter, healthier conscience that comes with taking a stand against injustice and making a commitment to non-violence.

Finally, unlike the Atkins, Paleo, or South Beach diets, which are trendy fads, veganism is neither a fad nor a diet, but a stand against injustice and commitment to non-violence that impacts one’s eating choices because of ethical considerations. Nevertheless, the growing number of strong, active vegans are a testament to the fact that one doesn’t have to sacrifice one’s physical health to embrace a more gentle way of life."
What is environmental veganism?,"Environmental vegans focus on conservation, rejecting the use of animal products on the premise that fishing, hunting, trapping and farming, particularly factory farming, are environmentally unsustainable. This specific form of veganism focuses its way of living on how to have a sustainable way of life without consuming animals."
What is ethical veganism?,"Ethical veganism, also known as moral veganism, is based on opposition to speciesism, the assignment of value to individuals on the basis of (animal) species membership alone."
What is moral veganism?,"Ethical veganism, also known as moral veganism, is based on opposition to speciesism, the assignment of value to individuals on the basis of (animal) species membership alone."
We evolved to eat meat? It's natural,"There’s no doubt that at many times in history, especially during periods of war and famine, the ability for people to eat meat helped ensure their survival. Likewise, there are some parts of the world today where local populations depend of fish, poultry, or livestock for protein and calories. That’s because marginal lands that won’t support agriculture can often still support the grazing of livestock, and some coastal areas have insufficient land for farming but access to substantial amounts of fish.

That said, few people living in developed countries can credibly claim that their survival depends on animal products. In terms of nutrition, there’s nothing in animal products that isn’t readily available from a well-planned vegan diet.

And if we were really intent on feeding the world, we would stop feeding a huge portion of the worldwide grain crop to livestock (which entails massive food waste), and instead grow grains for human consumption."
How hard is it to really become a vegan?,"Nearly every single vegan you ask will tell you the transition was much easier than they expected. While becoming vegan may sound difficult right now, you’ll no doubt be shocked by how easy this is, especially if you take the time to read up on the topic."
Are vegan diets really good for the environment?,"Raising animals for meat, milk, and dairy production wastes resources and damages the environment on a massive scale. When fed to farm animals, a substantial portion of the calories and nutrients present in grains is turned to manure. This manure invariably pollutes local water supplies and chokes rivers and other bodies of water. Worse yet, the meat and dairy industries are now recognized as a leading contributor to climate change.
"
Do vegans get enough vitamin B12?,"Vegans can get B12 through fortified soy milk, marmite and savoury yeast flakes. B12 has also been added to some other vegan products (eg. some Sanitarium burgers, sausages and ice ‘creams’ – check labels though as some Sanitarium products contain eggs and dairy).

We recommend that vegans take a B12 supplement as any B12 present in plant foods is not easily absorbed into the body. It is important to also realise B12 is usually supplemented into ‘livestock’ animals diets too, so there is no ‘natural’ way for getting B12 in today’s society."
If we all went vegan – wouldn't all the animals die out?,"It's true that the number of animals will fall as farmers breed fewer and fewer animals as the years go by. Farmed animals live a controlled, distorted life, often filled with pain and fear. The vast majority of farmed animals are kept in indoor units where they never see the light of day. Those that are kept outside are only kept alive for a fraction of their natural lifespans before being slaughtered for meat - often in the most barbaric manner imaginable. All farmed animals are born to die at our command - a disgusting idea.  In a vegan world animals would not be kept for profit and greed but would be allowed to exist in their natural state and live their life in freedom."
"If we all went vegan, we’d be overrun with animals?","Farmed animals are not allowed to reproduce naturally and farmers only breed animals when they can make a profit out of doing so. As demand for meat goes down over time, so fewer and fewer animals will be bred. That means that we will not be overrun by millions of farmed animals, as some people seem to imagine. Eventually, the few that are left can be allowed to go free: pigs can root around in woodlands as it is natural for them to do, sheep will graze the hillsides like deer and so on. Their populations will find their own natural levels, just like every other animal."
"If you were stuck on a desert island, would you eat meat?","Maybe – but if you were stuck on a desert island you might have to run around naked, never take a shower and wipe your bottom with leaves: that doesn’t mean that you should do those things the rest of the time."
Is alcohol vegan?,"Most spirits are vegan, although there are the more obvious ones that contain cream or honey that are not. Most wines and beers go through a filtering process, often using animal products. Such filtering agents include milk, albumen (from eggs), isinglass (from the swim bladders of fish) and gelatine. Labelling regulations require allergens such as milk and egg to be listed on labels, but it is not a requirement for isinglass or gelatine. Coopers, Boags and Heineken beers are all vegan. While almost all German (and Belgian) beers are vegan because of their laws for purity!"
Is honey vegan?,"Honey is an animal product and is therefore avoided by vegans. Surprisingly, a lot of bees are factory farmed and live in unnatural conditions. The queen is often artificially inseminated, has her wings clipped and is replaced (killed) after 1 or 2 years (normal life span is around 5 years). Try using agave nectar, maple syrup or golden syrup instead."
Is it more expensive?,"Being vegan needn’t be more expensive than a diet containing animal products. Some of the cheapest and healthiest foods available are great staples of a vegan diet, including cereals, beans, rice, potatoes, lentils, pasta, bread, fruits and vegetables. If you’re eating a balanced diet that includes animal products, you likely already buy and enjoy many of these anyway. Some vegan items such as vegan milks and cheese can be more expensive than their non-vegan counterparts, but this additional outlay is likely to be balanced by the savings you make through not having to buy meat."
"Is it possible to really be vegan, when animal ingredients are everywhere?","Although it’s true that in today’s world, it is almost impossible to avoid using some non-vegan items or ingredients, it is also true that avoiding most of them is easier than you think. The rising number of vegans each year has created an increased demand for vegan products. So much so that today, there are many incredibly delicious, easily attainable, and easy to prepare substitutes that would have seemed miraculous to vegan pioneers, such as pizza and ice cream! "
Is palm oil vegan?,"In itself, palm oil is a vegetable product which does not need to involve the (ab)use of animals, and therefore is suitable for vegans. The palm oil and palm timber industries are rife with very bad practices. In the EU, palm oil used in food must now be labelled, but ingredients derived from palm oil in food and non-food products still do not have to be labelled."
Is veganism healthy?,"Well-planned vegan diets contain all the nutrients we need to remain healthy. The British Dietetic Association (BDA) is the professional association for dietitians in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The BDA recognises that well-planned vegan diets can support healthy living in people of all ages. It's always a great idea to pay attention to nutritional needs, but this applies to everyone, not just vegans. Going vegan is great opportunity to pay more attention to your diet and health. The"
Isn’t it expensive to be vegan?,"There’s plenty of cheap yet high-quality vegan food out there, and the trick to finding it all is learning how to shop effectively. Once you learn a few basic shopping tips, it’s actually easier to eat an affordable vegan diet than one that contains animal products. The key to being vegan on the cheap is to buy unprocessed foods in bulk. Every good natural foods store has a bulk section where you can buy everything from beans to grains to nuts to granola. If you can keep most of your purchases to items costing under $3 a pound your grocery bill will be remarkably low."
It’s alright to eat animals if they’ve had a good life?,"Would it be alright to kill and eat people if they’d had a good life? And what do we mean by a ‘good’ life, anyway? In the case of animals, we certainly don’t mean a long one. ‘Meat’ animals are killed as babies in the case of lambs and veal calves or as soon as they become physically mature – the equivalent of human teenagers - and never get to lead any kind of adult life. Animals, of course, want to live just as much as we do. "
What about medicine?,Medicines prescribed by doctors are normally first tested on non-human animals. This is unavoidable under current laws. What you can do is ask your doctor for medicines that possibly don't contain animal ingredients. Medicines usually come with an information leaflet listing the ingredients. Ask your pharmacist for advice too.
What can I use instead of cow’s milk?,"There is a wide variety of non-dairy milks available. Your local supermarket is likely to stock the more common items such as soy, almond and rice milks, and many health food shops, organic stores and Asian supermarkets offer less common ones such as nut, oat, quinoa and hemp milks. These products can be found both on the shelf and in the refrigerated sections."
What difference will one person giving up meat make?,"A huge difference. The average British meat eater consumes, in the course of their lifetime, 5 cattle, 20 pigs, 29 sheep and lambs, 780 chickens, 46 turkeys, 18 ducks, 7 rabbits, 1, geese and half-a-tonne of fish. That is a lot of lives saved. Just as importantly, the best advertisement for veganism is a healthy and happy vegan: if you turn vegan you will be able to influence others to become part of the movement towards a more compassionate and rational world."
What is a vegan?,"Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. "
Is veganism good for your health?,"While no diet can guarantee a long and healthy life, becoming vegan may improve your odds. That’s largely because a vegan diet eliminates a number of unhealthful foods, including red and cured meats—two foods strongly linked to colon cancer. Vegans also tend to eat far more vegetables and fruits than non-vegetarians. Studies consistently show that people who eat the most fruits and vegetables tend to enjoy better health."
Why go vegan?,"A vegan lifestyle prevents a tremendous amount of animal slaughter and suffering. It offers a potent way to shrink our environmental footprint, especially in regard to climate change. And a well-planned vegan diet can fuel the highest levels of fitness, while reducing our risk of various chronic diseases. Plus, the food is insanely delicious and it becomes more widely available every year."
Why not just avoid factory farmed foods?,"Unless specifically labeled to the contrary, you can assume that every animal product came from a factory farm. As we’ve seen, every sort of cruelty is rampant at these places. A number of omnivores have pushed back against factory farm cruelties by demanding higher animal welfare standards. Most natural foods stores and supermarkets sell specially-labeled animal products from farms that promise better animal welfare. Additionally, many small-scale meat and egg producers rent stalls at local farmers’ markets. At their best, alternative farms deliver genuine improvements over factory farms. That’s mainly because they refuse to partake in the cruelest farming practices, particularly with regard to confinement and crowding. And with this reduced crowding, mutilations like beak searing and tail-clipping can be eliminated. That’s because animals unstressed by crowding are far less likely to attack or bully one another."
Will I need to supplement calcium if I don’t eat dairy?,"Not necessarily, you can get an adequate amount of calcium from a vegan diet. Good sources of calcium include green leafy vegetables, baked beans, black beans, dried figs, tahini and almonds. As well as this most plant milks are fortified with calcium too. In Australia the recommended calcium intake for adults ranges from 1000 to 1300 mg of calcium per day."
When was veganism created?,The term “vegan” was coined by the British animal rights activist Donald Watson in the 1940s. “Vegan” describes the philosophy that animals should not be exploited and hurt for food or other purposes.
Can you be an athlete on a vegan diet?,"From ultramarathoner Rich Roll and Olympian Carl Lewis to US Open winner Serena Williams, vegans prove time and again that you don’t need to support animal torture to be a star athlete."
Don’t cows need to be milked?,"Though it may seem obvious, many people have no idea that in order to produce milk, cows have to be pregnant or have just given birth. Like all other mammals, cows lactate for their babies."
What about human suffering?,Who says we can’t be vegan AND work to end human suffering? By choosing a humane vegan diet you are helping people as well as animals! 
How do vegans make cake?,"Many vegans like to use egg replacers, which are easy to make at home. Typical substitutes can include things like banana, flaxseed, applesauce and chia seeds."
Are vegans against pets?,"Pets are a blurry area for veganism, the reason for being how they're acquired. Pet shop practices that bring pets into existence are harmful to animals. If you can rescue an animal and have all the correct facilities and ability to keep them happy and healthy - then there is no issue."
Are vegans against wool?,"Most vegans are against wool, this is because wool is obtained by raising sheep with the sole purpose of shearing their wollen fleece. "
Who is the oldest vegan?,"The woman Loreen Dinwiddie lived to the age of 109, including 88 years she stuck to a strict vegan diet."
Do vegans live longer?,"On average, vegans and vegetarians live longer – they have longer life expectancies than meat-eaters, and grow old with fewer health issues. ... But, on average, vegans and vegetarians do live longer – they have lower mortality rates than meat-eaters, and grow old with fewer health issues (1)."
What would happen if everyone was vegan?,"According to a new study, a nation of 320 million vegans would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture by some 28%, far less than the amount now produced by the livestock industry."
"Animals Would Eat Us if They Could, and They Eat Each Other","Animals do all sorts of things to each other (and to us), including eating each other. Does this make it okay for us to do the same thing? There are three main issues with this.

The first is that not all animals eat each other - cows, for instance, are herbivores, so it seems a little unfair for us to eat them on the basis of other animals eating each other.
The second, much bigger issue is that animal behavior doesn't excuse our own behavior, because animals aren't able to understand or act according to morality. Like infants, they aren't responsible for what they do. The fact that an infant poops and vomits all over me doesn't show that it's okay for me to poop and vomit all over you. Unlike the infant, I have the ability to make moral choices."
Why should animals have rights?,"Why should children have rights?Why should the mentally handicapped have rights?Why should dogs have rights? (BTW, our pets have LOTS of rights)

Why should people from other countries have rights?

Why should anyone other than yourself have rights?

The answer to those questions is all the same: Because it's the right thing to do, because we want the right to our own body and life, and we have the capacity to understand that other beings, whether they can voice this desire or not, should be entitled to the same right."
Would you kill animals to control an invaisive species?,"A species is considered invasive due to either rapid reproduction or rapid destruction of another species. A species which does not rapidly reproduce and/or cause a rapid decline in another species is not invasive, it is a threat. By definition, an invasive species must be dealt with using death. There a number of ways to control species threats such as displacement, isolation, deterrence or other methods, however, invasive-species are are ones which adversely affect the environment.

Invasive animal species are quite often characterized as fast breeding, rapid growth, ability to live off a wide range of food types, strong tolerance to environmental changes and phenotypic plasticity.

What this means is a successful invasive species can eat anything, reproduces and grows fast, spreads quickly, is robust to environmental change and is able to rapidly change its immediate evolution (phenotype) to suit the demands of the new region. It becomes apparent quite quickly that there are two problems, invasive species compete for food and territory and food, as well as over-exhausting prey populations & they, outbreed native species.

There is only one solution to combat invasive species, you must ensure they don't breed. You could try to relocate them, but due to their rapid reproduction and growth and alarming dispersal, if they're not placed in a suitable ecosystem, they will become invasive in that one too. To ensure invasive species don't breed, you can either neuter them or you can kill them.

To break that down - neutering is a resource intensive solution and as identified, invasive species rapidly reproduce and mature. By the time a species is declared invasive, that is already a substantial population to capture, neuter and then release, to then cause destruction and death to the rest of the environment. The other problem with the solution of neutering is that if you see a feral animal, there is no effective way to tell if it is neutered or not.

The alternative is to simply declare those feral animals in certain areas to be killed. This is highly cost-effective and resource efficient, so much so that there is an actual industry for profitable varmit control - there is not a profitable industry for environmental conservation."
Would you eat roadkill?,"Roadkill is a great source of meat for obligate carnivores. If humans want to eat it, feel free, but since it is by no means necessary, I can't for the life of me understand why someone would."
Can zoos be ethical?,"There are three main ethical problems with zoos:

They normalize the idea that animals are only good for human pleasure and entertainment.

The animals on display are often kept in cramped, unnatural environments that take a toll on their mental health and general well being.

Keeping predators means keeping a supply chain of cheap meat to feed them. Zoos make little to no effort to ethically source their animal feed.

It's possible in principle to overcome these obstacles. It requires putting the animals' interests strictly higher than the human zoo patrons'. In practice, I think this would look more like an animal sanctuary than a zoo."
Where do vegans get Iron from?,"Iron is also a mineral, so it also comes from the ground like calcium. Most people can accept the mineral issue once you point it out to them but still have a hard time imagining that you can obtain enough iron through plants alone."
What About Omega 3 Fatty Acids?,"flax and chia are chock full of omega 3 fats, as are walnuts and hemp seeds"
is soy or soya bad for us?,"Evidence suggests that soya is not a threat to our health and is in fact a reliable and healthy protein source. Vegans aren't required to eat soya and it's possible to enjoy a healthy, well-balanced diet without it."
Can my dog/cat go vegan?,"Generally speaking most dogs and cats can follow a vegan diet. There are several good brands of vegan animal food available across the world, and these can be ordered online or found in some vegan stores. Dogs and particularly cats need an amino acid called taurine, which must be present in their food as it is essential for their wellbeing. This amino acid is found in animal products: however, it is also synthetically created on a commercial scale and is added to good quality vegan animal foods"
How many vegans are there in the UK?,"We found the number of vegans in Great Britain has quadrupled from 2014 to 2019. The numbers rose from 0.25% (150,000) of the population in 2014 to 0.46% (276,000) in 2016 to 1.16% in 2019 (600,000)."
If an animal is dead already can we eat them?,"We can go onto say that the animals are bred purely for you to eat them, so stop eating them and they will stop being bred for slaughter. Last year 400 million less animals were bred to be killed due to people decreasing their meat intake."
Which country is best for vegans?," The UK was the most popular country for veganism in 2019, according to Google Trends, followed by the Australia and New Zealand."
How many chickens are killed each year?,"Globally, more than 66 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of food, for both their meat and eggs."
