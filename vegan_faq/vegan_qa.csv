All the farmers would be unemployed if we stopped eating meat,People will still need to eat when we are all vegan so there will still be plenty of jobs for farmers! (In fact the intensive farming of animals has caused severe unemployment in agriculture as so few people are employed to look after so many animals. A vegan world would mean more employed in sustainable methods of farming.)
Alternative food movements,"In the 1960s and 1970s, a vegetarian food movement emerged as part of the counterculture in the United States that focused on concerns about diet, the environment, and a distrust of food producers, leading to increasing interest in organic gardening.[94][95] One of the most influential vegetarian books of that time was Frances Moore Lappé's 1971 text, Diet for a Small Planet.[96] It sold more than three million copies and suggested ""getting off the top of the food chain"".[97]

The following decades saw research by a group of scientists and doctors in the United States, including physicians Dean Ornish, Caldwell Esselstyn, Neal D. Barnard, John A. McDougall, Michael Greger, and biochemist T. Colin Campbell, who argued that diets based on animal fat and animal protein, such as the Western pattern diet, were detrimental to health.[98] They produced a series of books that recommend vegan or vegetarian diets, including McDougall's The McDougall Plan (1983), John Robbins's Diet for a New America (1987), which associated meat eating with environmental damage, and Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease (1990).[99] In 2003 two major North American dietitians' associations indicated that well-planned vegan diets were suitable for all life stages.[100] This was followed by the film Earthlings (2005), Campbell's The China Study (2005), Rory Freedman and Kim Barnouin's Skinny Bitch (2005), Jonathan Safran Foer's Eating Animals (2009), and the film Forks over Knives (2011).[101]

In the 1980s, veganism became associated with punk subculture and ideologies, particularly straight edge hardcore punk in the United States;[102] and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom.[103] This association continues on into the 21st century, as evinced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as Fluff Fest in Europe.[104][105]"
Animal Welfare,"Let’s begin with animal welfare, a simple concept arising out of common decency. Animal welfare’s core message is: if you’re going to use animals for food, cosmetics, or anything else, you are obligated to eliminate needless suffering. Unfortunately, that’s easier said than done. A great deal of the suffering intrinsic to animal use is expensive and difficult to remove. Verifying acceptable welfare is unreliable, since—as we’ve seen—farmers have every incentive to cheat. Once someone begins to pay attention to animal welfare, some degree of dietary change is virtually inevitable. Nearly everyone who thinks carefully about animal welfare ends up eating fewer animal-derived foods, since that’s the easiest and most reliable way to cut out cruelty. In order to eliminate additional suffering, people also switch to free-range and pasture-raised animal products.

Many omnivores who give animal welfare a close look ultimately decide they can’t make peace with slaughter. Objecting to slaughter doesn’t just close the door on consuming meat, but eggs and dairy products as well. But animal welfare is only one approach to thinking seriously about the ethics of eating. The most challenging ideas offered by the animal protection movement relate not to animal welfare, but to animal rights. Animal welfare condones virtually any use of animals, as long as we attempt to minimize suffering. Animal rights rejects this world view and emphatically proclaims that animals are not ours to use however we wish. As its name suggests, animal rights goes beyond animal welfare to proclaim that animals have rights. Just as it’s wrong to falsely imprison somebody, even if that prison is the Waldorf Astoria, it’s similarly wrong to raise animals for slaughter no matter how well they are kept."
Are free-range eggs ok?,"Most free range laying hens live in crowded sheds. Their outside area is generally restricted to a small enclosure with access via small exit holes which many hens are unable to reach and therefore have no outside access. The ones who do go outside are sometime trapped outside to be picked off by foxes. Hens can have a lifespan of 10 years, however they are often killed after 18 months when their productivity drops. Free range laying hens are the offspring of parent birds who are kept for their entire lives inside crowded, filthy sheds with no access to the outside. The hens and roosters are housed together for constant mating. The hens have no escape or respite from the roosters, their backs become featherless, red and sore from when roosters mount them. The female chicks of these parent birds are sent to free range, barn laid or caged sheds. The males are unwanted by-products and are killed soon after hatching, generally by being ground up alive in a macerator."
But where do you get your protein?,"Getting enough protein is not actually as hard as people will make you think. What people don’t realise is that protein is in virtually everything we eat! Plus most adults need only about 50g a day but consume considerably more than this.
Great vegan sources of protein include, tofu, tempeh, seitan, lentils, chickpeas, beans, nuts and seeds.
"
Can you still eat fish?,"We don’t want to state the obvious but… fish aren’t vegetables! Even though they are very different from us, they are still living and breathing sentient beings who experience suffering and pain, and they are not food."
Chickens and ducks,"Globally, more than 66 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of food, for both their meat and eggs. Every year in the UK we slaughter around 950 million birds for food consumption, including chickens, ducks and turkeys.
Over 90% of chicken production in the UK is in intensive windowless sheds which house 20,000-50,000 chickens each. 51% of eggs produced come from chickens in battery cages. 40 million day-old male chicks are killed in the UK by either being gassed or being thrown into a macerator - this practice occurs in all egg farming systems, including organic and free-range. Beak trimming is the permanent removal of part of the beak of a bird at a young age. This is standard industry practice in the UK despite being illegal in many European countries due to the pain it inflicts. A free-range egg farmer can legally house 16,000 birds in one building, meaning that they can house 9 birds per square metre of space. This means that free-range hens live out their entire lives in an overcrowded indoor farming unit. Around 95% of duck production and 90% of turkey production comes from intensive indoor farming."
Cows,"Dairy cows have been bred to produce up to 10 times more milk than they naturally would. Male calves are of no use to the dairy industry and are less suitable for beef production. This means that every year around 95,000 male dairy calves are shot soon after birth and discarded as a by-product. Domesticated cows have an average lifespan of 20 years, but on dairy farms they are killed after 5-6 years on average. 30% of UK dairy cows have mastitis, a bacterial infection of the udder. Every year on the UK, 2.6 million cattle are slaughtered for human consumption. Cows can naturally live for around 20 years, but are sent for slaughter at around 10 - 12 months old."
"Cows need to be milked, don’t they? We’re just doing them a favor.","A cow only needs to be milked because she had her calf taken away from her within a day or two of birth. The calf gets a cheap replacement formula generally made from slaughterhouse plasma and vitamins. Perhaps this strikes you as an unfair deal all the way around. And in a few months, after the cow’s milk yields peak, she’ll be re-impregnated once again to start the whole cycle all over. For more details, check out our page on dairy cows.

All in all, it’s a terrible life for these animals, especially the cows who live on “dry lot” dairies who are confined in crowded sheds. Disease is common, especially mastitis—an infection of the udders brought on by the enormous milk yields of modern-day dairy cows.

Luckily, it’s never been easier to go dairy-free. Excellent vegan versions of traditional dairy products are abundant and easy to find. Most groceries today carry soy, rice, and almond milk. And you can find excellent vegan cheese and ice cream at any natural foods store, and in better supermarkets. It’s also easy to find non-dairy yogurts, margarine, and even coffee creamer. Look for all these products in the dairy case."
Crowding at Factory Farms,"The most obvious component of factory farming pertains to the extreme crowding imposed on animals. This is especially the case in the egg industry. In countries and states that haven’t yet outlawed the practice, egg farmers keep their hens in “battery cages,” where each hen has less floor space than a sheet of printer paper. Additionally, these hens spend their entire lives standing on wire-bottomed cages. Predictably, the wire causes abrasions that lead to open sores and bruises. The birds sleep while being pressed against the cage and literally never have a moment of comfort. Pigs face comparably appalling living conditions, especially females used for breeding. These sows often spend their entire lives in gestation and farrowing crates. Standard crates forbid any sort of normal movement. In fact, they are so narrow that the sow lacks sufficient space to turn around. Pig urine produces vapors full of ammonia. At many pig farms, the air quality is so poor that the pigs commonly develop lung lesions. On top of that, workers have significantly elevated rates of respiratory problems. In fact, even people living on neighboring properties have impaired lung function.4 What about cows and cattle? Whether in person or in movies, we’ve all seen cows grazing scenic hillsides. Beef cattle are the only farm animals that nearly always live a portion of their lives outdoors in good conditions. Some dairy cows also spend much of their lives outdoors. But many dairies are factory farms that intensively confine their cows for their entire lives.

Even for the lucky cattle who spend time outside, this experience is only temporary. Beef cattle are invariably “finished” at feedlots. There, they live out their final months crowded onto filthy, barren plots of land. One such feedlot is the notorious Harris Ranch that’s adjacent to the Interstate 5 corridor of California. Having driven this stretch of Interstate countless times, I have often smelled the stench of the feedlot several kilometers before reaching it. The feedlot covers hundreds of acres, with seemingly every square meter crammed with animals amassed on black manure-coated earth. If you’ve seen one feedlot you’ve seen them all. Any large feedlot is basically indistinguishable from what you can see at Harris Ranch.

Conditions are just as bad, and nearly identical, at many dairy farms. The industry calls the most crowded of these places “dry lot” facilities. Some dairies are nearly indistinguishable from beef feedlots. The easiest way for an untrained observer to spot the difference is to look at the animals: most dairy cows have spotted coats whereas beef cattle are usually solid dark brown. As with beef cattle at feedlots, “dry lot” dairy cows have no opportunity to graze and are instead fed silage out of troughs. Twice a day, they’re hooked up to milking machines."
Do animals suffer?,"Animals have the same evolutionary past as us and the same reporting mechanisms for pain that we do; a brain and central nervous system. They also produce the same reactions in scenarios where pain would arise; they flinch and make noises of distress. There’s strong evidence too that animals experience mental suffering. In stressful situations vertebrates have been found to release adrenally-derived glucocorticoid hormones which “drive gluconeogenesis, suppress reproductive processes, alter movement and feeding rates, impact immune functions, and generally help an individual enter a ‘state of emergency’ when an environmental stressor induces their release”. Fish too, for example, “experience a rise in cortisol” (commonly known as the stress hormone) when confronted with factors capable of producing fear. There is even evidence that animals can experience mental illnesses just as we do."
Do plants suffer?,"Plants have input and output reactions to certain stimulation, for example photosynthesis, but they can’t experience pain or mental suffering due to not having a brain or central nervous system. Being vegan actually reduces the number of plants eaten because the animals we eat have to be fed on vast quantities of plants. Producing a kilogram of beef requires 25 kilograms of grain, one kilogram of pork requires nine kilograms of grain and one kilogram of chicken requires three kilograms of grain. This is also why the argument that eating meat is better than being vegan because more insects and small animals are killed in plant agriculture does not hold."
Do you have to sacrifice taste or variety?,"Not at all. Most of the flavour that we enjoy in foods comes from spices, herbs, salt and sugar, which are all plants. The Vegan Society has an excellent list of recipes for different styles and purposes and there’s so many out there that you’re bound to find vegan dishes you like. Variety also needn’t be an issue for vegans. There are myriad forms of fruits (68 here), vegetables (75 here), grains (21 here), legumes (hundreds here) and vegan meat and dairy substitutes."
"Does producing milk, cheese and eggs cause suffering?","These processes indeed cause great suffering to animals. Mother cows need to be pregnant to produce milk so from 15 months old they are forced into confined spaces every two or three months and artificially impregnated. After birth, the calf is removed from the mother within 36 hours; if the calf is male, he will likely be sold to be raised for veal or if there isn’t enough demand, he will be shot. The Drum reported in 2012 that 90,000 male calves are shot dead each year for this reason. If the calf is female, she will often be prepared to be a mother calf.Normally, a cow holds at most two litres of milk in her udder but the antibiotics farmers use for optimum milk production cause cows to carry 20 litres at any one time. The weight of this often makes cows lame or causes painful inflammation of the mammary glands (mastitis). Cows naturally live for up to 25 years but after 5 years of producing milk in these conditions their yield will no longer be profitable and they are slaughtered. In egg production, whether free range or not, hens have their beak painfully trimmed to prevent them injuring other hens due to the stress of confinement. They also experience a pre-mature death at around 80 weeks, when their natural life span is up to 8 years. Caged hens never see daylight and are restricted to space only slightly larger than a sheet of A4 paper. Male chicks are an unnecessary by-product of this process and are killed straight after hatching by incineration or gassing.   "
Does vegan food taste good?,"Yes it does! Our culture is all that limits us in eating an amazing selection of delicious vegan foods. We are increasingly programmed to eat highly processed and animal based diets. It is so much easier these days with plenty of vegan products and recipes available, and more coming into the market all the time"
Doesn’t the bible endorse eating animals?,"When it comes to food, the bible sends a lot of mixed messages. But there are some surprisingly pro-vegan bible passages. The Old Testament’s very first reference to food, Genesis 1:29, seems a clear admonition to be vegan:

And God said: ‘Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed—to you it shall be for food.

Later in the Old Testament, when God lays down which meats are permissible (kosher or halal), you get the sense he’s doing so begrudgingly, after being nagged into it by people lacking the fortitude to eat healthier vegan foods.

The Old Testament’s first book of Daniel likewise offers a strong endorsement for vegan eating. When Daniel and his companions visit the king, Daniel asks permission for the group to eat only vegetables and water for ten days. At the end of this time they’re in clearly superior health to other guests who ate animal-derived food from the king’s table.

To be clear, there are plenty of biblical references that support meat-eating. So no matter whether you want to be vegan or you want to eat meat, you’ll find biblical references to defend your position."
Don’t we need some animal products in our diet to be healthy?,"For those who might be concerned about meeting all their nutritional requirements with just plant foods, rest assured that even the mainstream and conservative Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the American Dietetic Association, and described by www.eatright.org as “the world’s largest organization of food and nutrition professionals”) confirms that you do not need to eat animal products to maintain your health.

“It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life-cycle including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood and adolescence and for athletes.

Many people who become vegan report that their health greatly improves as a result. Perhaps, the lighter, healthier body that emerges with veganism is a reflection of a lighter, healthier conscience that comes with taking a stand against injustice and making a commitment to non-violence.

Finally, unlike the Atkins, Paleo, or South Beach diets, which are trendy fads, veganism is neither a fad nor a diet, but a stand against injustice and commitment to non-violence that impacts one’s eating choices because of ethical considerations. Nevertheless, the growing number of strong, active vegans are a testament to the fact that one doesn’t have to sacrifice one’s physical health to embrace a more gentle way of life."
Eating fish doesn’t cause suffering.,"Yes it does. Numerous scientific studies have confirmed that fish do feel pain. Industrial fishing causes them immense suffering because they are killed either by being crushed in the net, having their swim bladders explode when they are brought to the surface or by asphyxiating (being starved of oxygen) on the decks of trawlers. Many fish, especially salmon, are also now intensively farmed and suffer from infectious illnesses, parasites and overcrowding."
Environmental veganism,"Environmental vegans focus on conservation, rejecting the use of animal products on the premise that fishing, hunting, trapping and farming, particularly factory farming, are environmentally unsustainable. In 2010, Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society called pigs and chicken ""major aquatic predators"", because livestock eat 40 percent of the fish that are caught.[21] Since 2002, all Sea Shepherd ships have been vegan for environmental reasons. This specific form of veganism focuses its way of living on how to have a sustainable way of life without consuming animals.[308]

According to a 2006 United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization report, Livestock's Long Shadow, around 26% of the planet's terrestrial surface is devoted to livestock grazing.[309] The UN report also concluded that livestock farming (mostly of cows, chickens and pigs) affects the air, land, soil, water, biodiversity and climate change.[310] Livestock consumed 1,174 million tonnes of food in 2002—including 7.6 million tonnes of fishmeal and 670 million tonnes of cereals, one-third of the global cereal harvest.[311] A 2017 study published in the journal Carbon Balance and Management found animal agriculture's global methane emissions are 11% higher than previous estimates based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.[312] A 2018 study found that global adoption of plant-based diets would reduce agricultural land use by 76% (3.1 billion hectares, an area the size of Africa) and cut total global greenhouse gas emissions by 28% (half of this emissions reduction came from avoided emissions from animal production including methane and nitrous oxide, and half came from trees re-growing on abandoned farmland which remove carbon dioxide from the air).[313][314]


Reduction of one's carbon footprint for various actions. A plant-based diet in this study referred to a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet. Vegan diets are known to have lower carbon footprints.[315]
A 2010 UN report, Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production, argued that animal products ""in general require more resources and cause higher emissions than plant-based alternatives"".[316]:80 It proposed a move away from animal products to reduce environmental damage.[v][317] A 2007 Cornell University study concluded that vegetarian diets use the least land per capita, but require higher quality land than is needed to feed animals.[318] A 2015 study determined that significant biodiversity loss can be attributed to the growing demand for meat, which is a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction, with species-rich habitats being converted to agriculture for livestock production.[319] A 2017 study by the World Wildlife Fund found that 60% of biodiversity loss can be attributed to the vast scale of feed crop cultivation needed to rear tens of billions of farm animals, which puts an enormous strain on natural resources resulting in an extensive loss of lands and species.[320] Livestock make up 60% of the biomass of all mammals on earth, followed by humans (36%) and wild mammals (4%). As for birds, 70% are domesticated, such as poultry, whereas only 30% are wild.[321][322] In November 2017, 15,364 world scientists signed a warning to humanity calling for, among other things, ""promoting dietary shifts towards mostly plant-based foods"".[323] The 2019 IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services found that industrial agriculture and overfishing are the primary drivers of the extinction crisis, with the meat and dairy industries having a substantial impact.[324][325] On August 8, 2019, the IPCC released a summary of the 2019 special report which asserted that a shift towards plant-based diets would help to mitigate and adapt to climate change.[326]"
Ethical veganism,"Ethical veganism, also known as moral vegetarianism, is based on opposition to speciesism, the assignment of value to individuals on the basis of (animal) species membership alone. Divisions within animal rights theory include the utilitarian, protectionist approach, which pursues improved conditions for animals. It also pertains to the rights-based abolitionism, which seeks to end human ownership of non-humans, including as pets. Abolitionists argue that protectionism serves only to make the public feel that animal use can be morally unproblematic (the ""happy meat"" position).[19]:62–63

Donald Watson, the first vegan activist and founder of The Vegan Society, stated in response to a question on why he was an ethical vegan, ""If an open-minded, honest person pursues a course long enough, and listens to all the criticisms, and in one's own mind can satisfactorily meet all the criticisms against that idea, sooner or later one's resistance against what one sees as evil tradition has to be discarded.""[289] On bloodsports, he has said that ""to kill creatures for fun must be the very dregs,"" and that vivisection and animal experimentation ""is probably the cruelest of all Man's attack on the rest of Creation."" He has also stated that ""vegetarianism, whilst being a necessary stepping-stone, between meat eating and veganism, is only a stepping stone.""[289]

Alex Hershaft, co-founder of the Farm Animal Rights Movement and Holocaust survivor, states he ""was always bothered by the idea of hitting a beautiful, living, innocent animal over the head, cutting him up into pieces, then shoving the pieces into [his] mouth,"" and that his experiences in the Nazi Holocaust allowed him ""to emphasize with the conditions of animals in factory farms, auction yards, and slaughterhouses"" because he ""knows firsthand what it's like to be treated like a worthless object.""[290]

Law professor Gary Francione, an abolitionist, argues that all sentient beings should have the right not to be treated as property, and that adopting veganism must be the baseline for anyone who believes that non-humans have intrinsic moral value.[u][19]:62 Philosopher Tom Regan, also a rights theorist, argues that animals possess value as ""subjects-of-a-life"", because they have beliefs, desires, memory and the ability to initiate action in pursuit of goals. The right of subjects-of-a-life not to be harmed can be overridden by other moral principles, but Regan argues that pleasure, convenience and the economic interests of farmers are not weighty enough.[292] Philosopher Peter Singer, a protectionist and utilitarian, argues that there is no moral or logical justification for failing to count animal suffering as a consequence when making decisions, and that killing animals should be rejected unless necessary for survival.[293] Despite this, he writes that ""ethical thinking can be sensitive to circumstances"", and that he is ""not too concerned about trivial infractions"".[294]

An argument proposed by Bruce Friedrich, also a protectionist, holds that strict adherence to veganism harms animals, because it focuses on personal purity, rather than encouraging people to give up whatever animal products they can.[295] For Francione, this is similar to arguing that, because human-rights abuses can never be eliminated, we should not defend human rights in situations we control. By failing to ask a server whether something contains animal products, we reinforce that the moral rights of animals are a matter of convenience, he argues. He concludes from this that the protectionist position fails on its own consequentialist terms.[19]:72–73

Philosopher Val Plumwood maintained that ethical veganism is ""subtly human-centred"", an example of what she called ""human/nature dualism"" because it views humanity as separate from the rest of nature. Ethical vegans want to admit non-humans into the category that deserves special protection, rather than recognize the ""ecological embeddedness"" of all.[296] Plumwood wrote that animal food may be an ""unnecessary evil"" from the perspective of the consumer who ""draws on the whole planet for nutritional needs""—and she strongly opposed factory farming—but for anyone relying on a much smaller ecosystem, it is very difficult or impossible to be vegan.[297]

Bioethicist Ben Mepham,[298] in his review of Francione and Garner's book The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition or Regulation?, concludes that ""if the aim of ethics is to choose the right, or best, course of action in specific circumstances 'all things considered', it is arguable that adherence to such an absolutist agenda is simplistic and open to serious self-contradictions. Or, as Farlie puts it, with characteristic panache: 'to conclude that veganism is the ""only ethical response"" is to take a big leap into a very muddy pond'.""[299] He cites as examples the adverse effects on animal wildlife derived from the agricultural practices necessary to sustain most vegan diets and the ethical contradiction of favoring the welfare of domesticated animals but not that of wild animals; the imbalance between the resources that are used to promote the welfare of animals as opposed to those destined to alleviate the suffering of the approximately one billion human beings who undergo malnutrition, abuse, and exploitation; the focus on attitudes and conditions in western developed countries, leaving out the rights and interests of societies whose economy, culture and, in some cases, survival rely on a symbiotic relationship with animals.[299]

David Pearce, a transhumanist philosopher, has argued that humanity has a ""hedonistic imperative"" to not merely avoid cruelty to animals or abolish the ownership of non-human animals, but also to redesign the global ecosystem such that wild animal suffering ceases to exist.[300] In the pursuit of abolishing suffering itself, Pearce promotes predation elimination among animals and the ""cross-species global analogue of the welfare state"". Fertility regulation could maintain herbivore populations at sustainable levels, ""a more civilised and compassionate policy option than famine, predation, and disease"".[301] The increasing number of vegans and vegetarians in the transhumanism movement has been attributed in part to Pearce's influence.[302]

A growing political philosophy that incorporates veganism as part of its revolutionary praxis is veganarchism, which seeks ""total abolition"" or ""total liberation"" for all animals, including humans. Veganarchists identify the state as unnecessary and harmful to animals, both human and non-human, and advocate for the adoption of a vegan lifestyle within a stateless society. The term was popularized in 1995 with Brian A. Dominick's pamphlet Animal Liberation and Social Revolution, described as ""a vegan perspective on anarchism or an anarchist perspective on veganism"".[303]

Direct action is a common practice among veganarchists (and anarchists generally) with groups like the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and Revolutionary Cells – Animal Liberation Brigade (RCALB) often engaging in such activities, sometimes criminally, to further their goals. Steven Best, animal rights activist and professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at El Paso, is an advocate of this approach, and has been critical of vegan activists like Francione for supporting animal liberation, but not total liberation, which would include not only opposition to ""the property status of animals"", but also ""a serious critique of capitalism, the state, property relations, and commodification dynamics in general."" In particular, he criticizes the focus on the simplistic and apolitical ""Go Vegan"" message directed mainly at wealthy Western audiences, while ignoring people of color, the working class and the poor, especially in the developing world, noting that ""for every person who becomes vegan, a thousand flesh eaters arise in China, India and Indonesia."" The ""faith in the singular efficacy of conjectural education and moral persuasion,"" Best writes, is no substitute for ""direct action, mass confrontation, civil disobedience, alliance politics, and struggle for radical change.""[304] Donald Watson has stated that he ""respects the people enormously who do it, believing that it's the most direct and quick way to achieve their ends.""[289]

Some vegans also embrace the philosophy of anti-natalism, as they see the two as complementary in terms of ""harm reduction"" to animals and the environment.[305]"
Farm Animal Suffering in Agribusiness,"As unsettling as slaughter may be to contemplate, it’s only the starting point for becoming acquainted with the ethical issues surrounding the raising of animals. It’s probable that most of the suffering and cruelty tied to the meat, dairy, and egg industries relates to how the animals are raised rather than how they are killed. I know that thinking about animal suffering is extraordinarily unpleasant, and it’s only natural to want to turn away from hearing the gory details. If you find yourself especially troubled by having to listen to this awful stuff, perhaps that right there is the best reason of all to move towards a vegan diet. As we’re about to see, if you wanted to design a system that torments countless billions of animals in a multitude of disturbing ways, the methods employed by modern-day factory farming would be impossible to beat. Each year, about 50 billion farm animals are subjected to factory farm conditions.1 Let’s now look at what they face."
Fish and other sea animals,"Half of all plastic in the sea comes from fishing. Three quarters of the world's fisheries are either exploited or depleted. We kill between 1 and 2.8 trillion fish every year. This is 143-400x the amount of the entire human population.308,000 cetaceans are inintentionally drowned each year after becoming entangled in fishing equipment. Farmed salmon has 10x the amount of cancer-causing organic pollutants than wild salmon. For every pound of fish caught, up to 5 pounds of unintended marine species are caught and discarded as by-kill. Sharks kill 12 people per year. People kill 11,414 sharks per hour. "
God put animals on earth for us to eat.,"Most of us in the UK do not follow religious rules in our lives - but even amongst people with strong religious faith, there is considerable disagreement about whether God wants us to eat animals. No major religions command their followers to eat meat and many devout Christians, Moslems, Buddhists and Jews are vegetarian as are all Hare Krishnas and Jains. Most Hindus, of course, eat no red meat. For most religious people the question remains one of individual judgement. Most religions, however, celebrate compassion, kindness and mercy. The abattoir and the factory farm do not seem consistent with that."
Haven’t we evolved to eat meat? It’s natural!,"There’s no doubt that at many times in history, especially during periods of war and famine, the ability for people to eat meat helped ensure their survival. Likewise, there are some parts of the world today where local populations depend of fish, poultry, or livestock for protein and calories. That’s because marginal lands that won’t support agriculture can often still support the grazing of livestock, and some coastal areas have insufficient land for farming but access to substantial amounts of fish.

That said, few people living in developed countries can credibly claim that their survival depends on animal products. In terms of nutrition, there’s nothing in animal products that isn’t readily available from a well-planned vegan diet.

And if we were really intent on feeding the world, we would stop feeding a huge portion of the worldwide grain crop to livestock (which entails massive food waste), and instead grow grains for human consumption."
History & Origins,"The practice can be traced to Indus Valley Civilization in 3300–1300 BCE in the Indian subcontinent,[49][50][51] particularly in northern and western ancient India.[52] Early vegetarians included Indian philosophers such as Mahavira and Acharya Kundakunda, the Tamil poet Valluvar, the Indian emperors Chandragupta Maurya and Ashoka; Greek philosophers such as Empedocles, Theophrastus, Plutarch, Plotinus, and Porphyry; and the Roman poet Ovid and the playwright Seneca the Younger.[53][54] The Greek sage Pythagoras may have advocated an early form of strict vegetarianism,[55][56] but his life is so obscure that it is disputed whether he ever advocated any form of vegetarianism at all.[57] He almost certainly prohibited his followers from eating beans[57] and from wearing woolen garments.[57] Eudoxus of Cnidus, a student of Archytas and Plato, writes that ""Pythagoras was distinguished by such purity and so avoided killing and killers that he not only abstained from animal foods, but even kept his distance from cooks and hunters"".[57] One of the earliest known vegans was the Arab poet al-Maʿarri (c. 973 – c. 1057).[a][58] Their arguments were based on health, the transmigration of souls, animal welfare, and the view—espoused by Porphyry in De Abstinentia ab Esu Animalium (""On Abstinence from Animal Food"", c. 268 – c. 270)—that if humans deserve justice, then so do animals.[53]

Vegetarianism established itself as a significant movement in 19th-century Britain and the United States.[59] A minority of vegetarians avoided animal food entirely.[60] In 1813, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley published A Vindication of Natural Diet, advocating ""abstinence from animal food and spirituous liquors"", and in 1815, William Lambe, a London physician, stated that his ""water and vegetable diet"" could cure anything from tuberculosis to acne.[61] Lambe called animal food a ""habitual irritation"", and argued that ""milk eating and flesh-eating are but branches of a common system and they must stand or fall together"".[62] Sylvester Graham's meatless Graham diet—mostly fruit, vegetables, water, and bread made at home with stoneground flour—became popular as a health remedy in the 1830s in the United States.[63] Several vegan communities were established around this time. In Massachusetts, Amos Bronson Alcott, father of the novelist Louisa May Alcott, opened the Temple School in 1834 and Fruitlands in 1844,[64][j] and in England, James Pierrepont Greaves founded the Concordium, a vegan community at Alcott House on Ham Common, in 1838.[4][66]"
"How do I know if a coconut or coconut-containing product has been picked by monkeys, not humans?",It was brought to our attention in early 2016 that monkeys may be being used to harvest coconuts in South East Asian countries. Since then we have been conducting research and contacting suppliers. The majority of coconut suppliers we have spoken to confirm that humans with long sticks or machinery are used in the harvesting process in these regions. Rarely do they know of any cases that animals are used.
How hard is it to really become a vegan?,"Nearly every single vegan you ask will tell you the transition was much easier than they expected. While becoming vegan may sound difficult right now, you’ll no doubt be shocked by how easy this is, especially if you take the time to read up on the topic."
How to Vegan Diets Protect the Environment?,"How to Vegan Diets Protect the Environment?
Raising animals for meat, milk, and dairy production wastes resources and damages the environment on a massive scale. When fed to farm animals, a substantial portion of the calories and nutrients present in grains is turned to manure. This manure invariably pollutes local water supplies and chokes rivers and other bodies of water. Worse yet, the meat and dairy industries are now recognized as a leading contributor to climate change.

Let’s now look more closely at all these considerations.

Eating with the Planet in Mind
Written by Frances Moore Lappé all the way back in 1971, Diet for a Small Planet was the most influential food politics book of its generation. Through her writing, Lappé awakened the public to the merits of eating lower on the food chain. That means basing your diet directly on plants, rather than on animals who in turn eat plants. Diet for a Small Planet was the first bestseller to explore how plant-based diets can shrink your environmental footprint.

Lappé helped establish food politics as a serious discipline by revealing the extraordinarily inefficiencies connected to animal farming. She showed how feeding grain to poultry and livestock wastes tremendous amounts of food energy, protein, and other nutrients. Not only is it a terrible loss to squander food resources on such a massive scale, the animal manure generated is a serious menace in it own right.

Animal Manure and Dead Zones
Cows and pigs and chickens produce mountains of manure, which causes massive environmental problems. Although animal waste makes outstanding fertilizer, its high water content makes manure too expensive to truck to distant farmlands to fertilize crops.

So instead of putting it to productive use as fertilizer, factory farms often get rid of their manure by spraying it onto neighboring lands. Predictably, this method of disposal tends to foul local water supplies, especially well-water.

During heavy rains, flooding washes these pollutants into rivers. In the United States, much of this farm runoff ends up in the Gulf of Mexico, with dire consequences. The massive influx of nitrates and phosphates cause algal blooms that create a vast oxygen-free “dead zone” in the Gulf. The size and location of this dead zone varies with season and weather, but averages more than 15,000 square kilometers. Whenever it expands into new territory, virtually all fish and other marine life suffocate.17 Similar devastation for similar reasons occurs in the Chesapeake Bay, which is surrounded by a large portion of America’s poultry farms.

Animal Agriculture’s Contribution to Climate Change
Of all the environmental reasons to embrace a plant-based diet, the strongest was unknown until recently. Scientists did not reach broad consensus about the risk of severe climate change until the 2000s. Around this time, researchers began serious work to identify the primary sources of greenhouse gases. They thereby discovered that the livestock industry is a main driver of climate change.

The world’s cows, pigs, and chickens probably surpass automobiles as a cause of climate change. The 74 billion farm animals raised worldwide each year collectively spew massive amounts of methane into the atmosphere. Methane is an immensely potent greenhouse gas. It traps at least thirty times more atmospheric heat than an equal amount of carbon dioxide.

Estimates vary regarding the percentage of climate change attributable to animal agriculture, but a comprehensive United Nations study pegged the industry’s contribution to the problem at about 14.5 percent.18

Now, it’s true that greater efficiencies in livestock production have, over time, decreased emissions per animal. But regardless, animal agriculture is still a top emitter of greenhouse gases—and is undoubtedly the most sensible source to prioritize. Society can’t do away with gasoline-powered cars overnight, nor can we abruptly convert to predominantly clean energy sources for electricity. But switching to a plant-based diet is easy, and in most cases actually saves money. Plant-based diets therefore deserve recognition as the most realistic opportunity to slash greenhouse gas emissions.

A Word About Seafood
Much of the writing addressing the “why go vegan?” question either insufficiently covers the problems related to seafood or ignores the topic outright. For most people moving gradually towards a vegetarian diet, seafood is the very last food they’ll stop eating.

But there are strong reasons to rid your diet of seafood. This is especially true for crabs and lobsters, since these animals are generally boiled alive. By all the available evidence, this is an excruciating ordeal that’s indefensible to deliberately inflict onto another being.19

Can Fish Suffer?
What about fish netted for food, or caught on fishing lines? Are they capable of suffering? And, if so, how severely can they suffer?

Studies definitively prove that fish are indeed capable of suffering, both when hooked or netted.20 However they’re caught, death usually occurs either through suffocation. Deep water fish often die a particularly agonizing death—as they’re pulled to the water’s surface, their organs frequently rupture from depressurization.

What’s more, the crowding and welfare standards at fish farms are every bit as deplorable as at any factory farm. Fish farms often use antibiotics in massive quantities. And the crowding at many fish farms commonly causes infestations of gruesome parasites called sea lice. These parasites attach themselves to the fish and eat away at the skin, causing open lesions.

Genetic modification produces widespread deformities and even deafness among farmed salmon. Perhaps most disturbing, these fish routinely escape into the open ocean where they can mate with wild fish. This interbreeding causes unpredictable and potentially ruinous consequences to the gene pool of native fish species.

The Environmental Cost of Fishing
Overwhelming evidence places the fishing industry among the world’s greatest environmental menaces. And the worldwide appetite for fish is insatiable. Since 1960, the amount of seafood taken daily from the world’s oceans, rivers, and lakes has more than tripled.21 As a result, fish populations around the world are in steep decline.22 There simply isn’t enough fish to go around, and in some parts of the world, populations utterly depend on fish for survival. Perhaps, then, if people must eat seafood, it should only go to populations that would face hunger without it.

If enforcing farm animal welfare sounds hard, imagine trying to monitor fishing boats that operate in distant oceans. Fishing boats commonly switch off their electronic tracking equipment to evade the enforcement of catch limits.23 In some parts of the world, fishing fleets have unleashed irreversible environmental catastrophe. One prime example involves the coastline of Newfoundland, which was once among the world’s most abundant cod fisheries. Over-fishing so ravaged the ecosystem that the cod have forever vanished, replaced by scavenger species like crab and lobster.

The fishing industry decimates marine species of every sort. The industry uses the term “by-catch” to describe the non-targeted marine life it kills. The world’s fishing boats are constantly pulling thousands of kilometers of nets through the sea. These nets ensnare every animal in their path. Countless dolphins, sea turtles, sharks, and seabirds suffocate in these nets. Every kilogram of shrimp scooped up shrimping boats results in 4 to 6 kilograms of by-catch.24

Moving from “Why Go Vegan?” to “How to Go Vegan?”
Given how many subjects relate to vegan and plant-based diets, this essay could offer only the briefest coverage of only the most important issues. But at least you now know enough to begin thinking productively about the topic.

If there’s one point that I hope this essay convincingly made, it’s that our food choices matter immensely. The way we eat has an enormous impact on animals, the planet, and of course our quality of life. Your appreciation for the magnitude of this issue will only grow as you continue exploring the topic, and I hope I’ve inspired you to dive deeper into learning about food politics.

Small Changes Beat No Changes
Many people succumb to all-or-nothing thinking when it comes to contemplating dietary change. That is, if they decide they aren’t ready to go vegan, they’ll take no action at all. But even the smallest steps can deliver important results, while laying the groundwork for more progress in the future.

So if you’re not ready to commit to major dietary change, even small shifts are worthwhile. Concepts like Meat Free Mondays, Reducetarian diets, and Vegan Before 6:00 offer something for everyone. If there’s an animal product you presently eat that you don’t really enjoy, why not cut it out today?

Above All, Enjoy Yourself!
Know that gravitating toward plant-based foods can be exciting and fun. It emphatically should not involve feelings of deprivation and sacrifice. To the contrary, it’s all about discovery. The key point is that just by trying new foods frequently, your diet will automatically move in a positive direction.

If you’re not enjoying the process, it probably means your approach is focused on sacrifice rather than on discovery. Done properly, the switch to a vegan diet requires zero willpower. A successful transition to a vegan diet doesn’t demand cutting out foods. Instead, it’s wisest to crowd out non-vegan foods from your diet by finding new vegan foods you prefer. The more often you sample new vegan foods, the more quickly you will gain ground.

I’ve followed a vegan diet for more than thirty years, so I hope you’ll take my word for this. As you continue down the road of eating more vegan foods, the amount of pleasure you derive from eating won’t decrease—it will instead grow by leaps and bounds. You’ll experience a wider variety of delicious food than ever before, and you’ll probably feel better as well.

On top of everything I’ve covered here, there’s one additional benefit of eating vegan meals you may have never considered. Nothing beats the feeling you’ll get from supporting a food business run by people with the most honorable intentions.

Always Take the Easy Route
So, when transitioning your diet, give yourself every advantage. You don’t have to figure everything out on your own. There are a number of fabulous resources to show you the way, and a little reading pays off big time. My essay on how to go vegan will teach you more useful information in thirty minutes than you’d learn from months of following a vegan diet. After reading it, consider getting ahold of a couple vegan cookbooks devoted to quick and easy recipes.

Above all, enjoy yourself. Food is undeniably one of life’s great pleasures. And when you bring your diet into alignment with your core values and beliefs, you’ll gain a whole new level of satisfaction from eating."
I don’t mind you being vegan – but you shouldn’t try to impose your views on other people. It’s a matter of individual choice.,"Trying to persuade people to change their minds is not “imposing your views” upon them. It is the kind of healthy disagreement which democracy depends on and which is essential for change to take place. What we eat is also not simply a matter for individuals. Meat-eating and veganism are not two sides of the same coin: one brings death and suffering to animals, damages the planet and harms human health and the other doesn’t. The reason that vegans try to change the minds of non-vegans is because their “individual choice” affects countless other beings, human and non-human."
"I like the idea, but isn’t it difficult to be vegan?","Living as a vegan, especially for those of us in the developed world, is much, much easier than it is commonly perceived to be. As we wrote back in 2012:

“During the past few years, the call to reduce our consumption of animal products has grown tremendously… Vegan recipe blogs have proliferated into the hundreds, if not thousands. Both the number and the variety of vegan items available in stores and online are increasing annually. New vegan businesses are opening and thriving more than ever, including cafes, bakeries, restaurants, grocery stores, clothing stores, online boutiques, and even retreat centers and B&Bs…”

Yes, there’s never been a better time. And as the demand for vegan alternatives grows, it’s only going to get even easier.

There certainly is an initial learning period, during which new habits are established, and the vegan newbie might be surprised or even shocked to learn where certain animal products find their way into our lives. But each time we pass up a non-vegan item in favor of a vegan alternative (or even in favor of no alternative, as many of us have done many a time) we can feel strengthened by our knowledge that we have not sacrificed our covenant with the animals for something as trivial as taste, habit, comfort, or convenience."
I only eat organic/free range/fish/chicken/dairy anyway,"Good. Any choice that people make which reduces animal suffering is a welcome choice – but why stop at some kinds of animal or some kinds of suffering? Fish and chicken feel pain and have an instinct to preserve their own lives in just the same way as cows and pigs. They may be less attractive animals to you but that doesn’t mean that their lives and suffering are less important to them. Similarly, although free range and organic animals usually (although not always) lead better lives than factory farmed animals, they still suffer in many ways. For example, so-called free range egg farms may involve thousands of hens being kept in a shed with limited access to outside and to limited land. Even in the better free range/organic egg farms, all male chicks are killed within hours – useless by-products as they do not lay eggs and are too scrawny for meat. All animals kept for farming are prevented from mixing in normal social groups, and ducks never see their ducklings; hens their chicks; pigs have their piglets taken away much too young; dairy cows have their calves ripped from them at one day old. Even on free range farms the male calves are shot as they don’t give milk and are the wrong breed for beef. All farms prevent animals from living natural lives. And all are sent for slaughter as soon as there is more profit in killing them than in keeping them alive. There is no need to farm or to slaughter any animal. Eating any kind of meat contributes to animal suffering – and to the environmental and world hunger problems caused by the meat industry. The less meat people eat the better and many people find that cutting out meat gradually works best for them – but ultimately, the only truly consistent and ethical choice is to eat no meat, dairy or eggs at all."
I’ve heard that vegans have trouble getting enough B12?,"Vegans can get B12 through fortified soy milk, marmite and savoury yeast flakes. B12 has also been added to some other vegan products (eg. some Sanitarium burgers, sausages and ice ‘creams’ – check labels though as some Sanitarium products contain eggs and dairy).

We recommend that vegans take a B12 supplement as any B12 present in plant foods is not easily absorbed into the body. It is important to also realise B12 is usually supplemented into ‘livestock’ animals diets too, so there is no ‘natural’ way for getting B12 in today’s society."
"If everyone went vegan, wouldn’t animals take over the world?","No. It is a simple supply and demand issue- the more vegans there are, the less animals will be farmed."
"If the animals weren’t happy and healthy, they wouldn’t grow/lay eggs etc.","Just not true. People don’t grow big because they’re happy and neither do animals. Meat chickens today grow almost twice as fast as they did 50 years ago – yet they live in far worse conditions, crammed into stinking, windowless broiler sheds by the tens of thousands and suffering from lameness and other problems. They don’t grow big because they’re happy but because they have been selectively bred to gain weight quickly, are given growth-promoting drugs and are fed on special diets. Similarly, dairy cows have been bred to produce far more milk than is natural to them. In fact, the dairy industry relies upon making animals unhappy – by taking their calves away so that humans can drink their mothers’ milk – in order to function. Laying hens have been bred to produce so many eggs that they lose calcium into the shells and suffer from brittle bones and fractures as a result. They don’t lay eggs because they’re happy: they have no choice"
"If we all ate vegetables and crops, wouldn’t we need more pesticides?","No. Setting aside the question of whether pesticides are needed at all, if everyone were vegan we would use less pesticides because we would actually grow less crops. Meat animals all eat plants and they convert them into food very inefficiently. On average, a farmed animal has to eat 10kg of plant protein in order to make 1kg of meat – in other words, if the same land was used to grow crops for people to eat, it would be ten times more productive. To put it yet another way, 90% of the crops we feed to animals are wasted. If we didn’t eat animals, we wouldn’t need to grow those crops or use chemicals on them."
If we all went vegan – wouldn't all the animals die out?,"The converse of the above question – we vegans hear ‘em all! It's true that the number of animals will fall as farmers breed fewer and fewer animals as the years go by. Farmed animals live a controlled, distorted life, often filled with pain and fear. The vast majority of farmed animals are kept in indoor units where they never see the light of day. Those that are kept outside are only kept alive for a fraction of their natural lifespans before being slaughtered for meat - often in the most barbaric manner imaginable. All farmed animals are born to die at our command - a disgusting idea. Also some breeds have been so changed from their natural ancestor that it would be kinder to let them die out. For example, broiler chickens and turkeys bred for meat are often so obese that they can barely walk and suffer from crippling leg disorders. However we could set up large nature reserves for the more traditional (now rare) breeds that haven't been so changed. There would be much more land available for reserves because most of it is used to grow crops for fattening animals at present. Also, there would be more space for forests and woods and other wildlife reservations where genuinely wild British species of animal and plants could flourish. In other countries we could encourage the breeding of our farm animal's wild ancestors - the wild pig, turkeys and jungle fowl (the forerunner of the battery hen) by stopping the destruction of their homes. Many people forget that all farmed animals have been bred from wild animals – and that their natural ancestors need preserving. In a vegan world animals would not be kept for profit and greed but would be allowed to exist in their natural state and live their life in freedom."
"If we all went vegan, we’d be overrun with animals?","Farmed animals are not allowed to reproduce naturally and farmers only breed animals when they can make a profit out of doing so. As demand for meat goes down over time, so fewer and fewer animals will be bred. That means that we will not be overrun by millions of farmed animals, as some people seem to imagine. Eventually, the few that are left can be allowed to go free: pigs can root around in woodlands as it is natural for them to do, sheep will graze the hillsides like deer and so on. Their populations will find their own natural levels, just like every other animal."
"If you were stuck on a desert island, you’d have to eat meat.","Maybe – but if you were stuck on a desert island you might have to run around naked, never take a shower and wipe your bottom with leaves: that doesn’t mean that you should do those things the rest of the time."
Is alcohol vegan?,"Most spirits are vegan, although there are the more obvious ones that contain cream or honey that are not. Most wines and beers go through a filtering process, often using animal products. Such filtering agents include milk, albumen (from eggs), isinglass (from the swim bladders of fish) and gelatine. Labelling regulations require allergens such as milk and egg to be listed on labels, but it is not a requirement for isinglass or gelatine. Coopers, Boags and Heineken beers are all vegan. While almost all German (and Belgian) beers are vegan because of their laws for purity!"
Is honey vegan?,"Honey is an animal product and is therefore avoided by vegans. Surprisingly, a lot of bees are factory farmed and live in unnatural conditions. The queen is often artificially inseminated, has her wings clipped and is replaced (killed) after 1 or 2 years (normal life span is around 5 years). Try using agave nectar, maple syrup or golden syrup instead."
Is it hard to get vegan food?,"If you do a weekly shop in a supermarket you shouldn’t have any trouble finding vegan food. For example, typing ‘vegan’ into the Morrisons groceries website returns over 1,500 products. If you’re used to shopping at very small local shops, then you might find less variety of meat substitutes. If you’re keen to have these and don’t live or work near bigger supermarkets, you can always buy food on a supermarket website and have it delivered at an average cost of £3 a time or even less if you sign up for unlimited deliveries throughout the year."
Is it more expensive?,"Being vegan needn’t be more expensive than a diet containing animal products. Some of the cheapest and healthiest foods available are great staples of a vegan diet, including cereals, beans, rice, potatoes, lentils, pasta, bread, fruits and vegetables. If you’re eating a balanced diet that includes animal products, you likely already buy and enjoy many of these anyway. Some vegan items such as vegan milks and cheese can be more expensive than their non-vegan counterparts, but this additional outlay is likely to be balanced by the savings you make through not having to buy meat."
"Is it possible to really be vegan, when animal ingredients are everywhere?","Although it’s true that in today’s world, it is almost impossible to avoid using some non-vegan items or ingredients, it is also true that avoiding most of them is easier than you think. The rising number of vegans each year has created an increased demand for vegan products. So much so that today, there are many incredibly delicious, easily attainable, and easy to prepare substitutes that would have seemed miraculous to vegan pioneers, such as pizza and ice cream! There’s also a growing number of high-quality replacements for non-vegan clothing, toiletries, cleaning products, household items, and anything else we need to live without exploiting animals.

Every time anyone takes a stand for non-human animals and their right to live free from human oppression, he or she moves all of humanity one giant step closer to a vegan world, where animal fat in our tires and crushed insects in our food will be but a distant memory of less civilized times.

In the meantime, we can at least do our very best to avoid animal ingredients and businesses wherever possible."
Is palm oil vegan?,"In itself, palm oil is a vegetable product which does not need to involve the (ab)use of animals, and therefore is suitable for vegans. The palm oil and palm timber industries are rife with very bad practices. In the EU, palm oil used in food must now be labelled, but ingredients derived from palm oil in food and non-food products still do not have to be labelled. So it is not possible for consumers to boycott palm products. Instead, ending the abuses of the palm tree (oil and timber) industries requires co-ordinated action by consumers, policymakers, vegans and non-vegans together.

Vegans should also be aware that due the fact that single-issue campaigns have focused solely on the negative effects of palm oil, other types of crop farming, which cause harm to many animals, are overlooked. The Vegan Society is working towards a world where animals are not (ab)used for human purposes. We encourage stock-free farming and alternatives to widespread crop clearance and other farming methods which currently cause many animals to die every year. Unfortunately, it is not yet possible or practical for individual vegans to only support vegan farming. However, the consumption of plant-based crops such as wheat, barley, oil palm and soybeans causes far fewer animals to lose their lives than eating animals."
Is veganism healthy?,"Well-planned vegan diets contain all the nutrients we need to remain healthy. The British Dietetic Association (BDA) is the professional association for dietitians in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The BDA recognises that well-planned vegan diets can support healthy living in people of all ages. It's always a great idea to pay attention to nutritional needs, but this applies to everyone, not just vegans. Going vegan is great opportunity to pay more attention to your diet and health. The"
Isn’t it expensive to be vegan?,"There’s plenty of cheap yet high-quality vegan food out there, and the trick to finding it all is learning how to shop effectively. Once you learn a few basic shopping tips, it’s actually easier to eat an affordable vegan diet than one that contains animal products.

The key to being vegan on the cheap is to buy unprocessed foods in bulk. Every good natural foods store has a bulk section where you can buy everything from beans to grains to nuts to granola. If you can keep most of your purchases to items costing under $3 a pound your grocery bill will be remarkably low.

But what about produce? You’ll dramatically cut costs if you learn when different fruits and vegetables hit peak of season. In North America, that means peas and strawberries in May, cherries in June, peaches and watermelons in August, and apples in November. When you buy produce items at its peak of season, you’ll get the highest quality food at the lowest price. If you extra-motivated to minimize your produce costs, remember that most supermarkets offer outrageously good sale prices on a few produce items every week—just check the market’s weekly flyer when you walk into the store.

Amazon.com can be a great source of inexpensive convenience foods. We’ve collected Amazon’s best vegan food deals on our grocery page.

The one area where vegan foods consistently cost more is frozen dinners. That’s largely because vegan offerings tend to be made from high quality organic ingredients, whereas conventional TV dinners are made from the worst factory-farmed dreck imaginable. If most of your food is frozen vegan dinners, you’ll undoubtedly have a higher grocery bill than a typical omnivore. But you can get around this by learning to cook. Two cookbooks are specifically geared to eating cheaply on a vegan diet: Robin Robertson’s Vegan on the Cheap, and Ellen Jaffe Jones’ Eat Vegan on $4.00 a Day."
Isn’t it hard to be vegan?,"et’s be honest. If you grew up eating meat, milk, and eggs in almost every meal, the idea of going vegan certainly seems hard—maybe even impossible!

But most vegans discover the switch is far easier than they ever imagined. All you have to do is focus on crowding out animal-based foods rather than cutting them out. That is, don’t eliminate a meat, dairy, or egg product from your diet until you’ve found two or three great new vegan foods than can take its place. When you focus on crowding rather than cutting, you eliminate all feelings of strain and sacrifice. Your diet actually becomes more interesting, varied, and delicious as you fill it with more and more vegan foods."
Isn't eating meat is natural?,"As we’ve just seen, it isn’t. Humans have only eaten meat in relatively recent evolutionary history and then only through the use of tools like spears and fire. Only when we started farming (hardly natural!) did meat become even a regular part of most human beings’ diets and eating meat on a daily basis is very recent - since the advent of factory farming after the Second World War. This brought the cost of rearing animals down and the meat eating explosion was the result. In 1946, for example, the number of poultry eaten in Britain was 31.9 million and in 2001 it was over 800 million. And what’s natural about factory farming, live exports and slaughterhouses?"
It’s alright to eat animals if they’ve had a good life?,"Would it be alright to kill and eat people if they’d had a good life? And what do we mean by a ‘good’ life, anyway? In the case of animals, we certainly don’t mean a long one. ‘Meat’ animals are killed as babies in the case of lambs and veal calves or as soon as they become physically mature – the equivalent of human teenagers - and never get to lead any kind of adult life. Animals, of course, want to live just as much as we do. The first instinct every animal has is to survive. By killing them at all, we are taking away from them the most important thing they have; we are denying their intrinsic right to life. It is also naïve to imagine that any farmed animals lead good lives: the overwhelming majority of them are exploited, neglected and frustrated on factory farms – forced to lead lives of misery by a farming system which sees them only as ways of producing a profit. They then face a violent, frightening death in the slaughterhouse: despite supposedly humane stunning, millions of animals are still conscious when their throats are cut. Even free range and organic animals suffer on farms (see question 6) and they face the same shocking death at a young age as factory-farmed animals."
Lots of animals kill for food: why shouldn’t we?,"Animals do lots of things we don’t do and wouldn’t do! Anyway, we shouldn’t kill because we have a choice. Lions and tigers etc have to kill to survive (they are known as obligate carnivores): we don’t. Animals can only follow their instincts but we human beings can think about the consequences of our actions. We can recognise the suffering of other animals and we can choose not to inflict it on them. If we choose to make them suffer, what does that say about the human race? Eating meat, fish, eggs and dairy is causing mass pain and suffering; it is destroying the earth and is costing the health services millions."
Mainstream,"The vegan diet became increasingly mainstream in the 2010s,[42][43][106] especially in the latter half.[43][107] The Economist declared 2019 ""the year of the vegan"".[108] The European Parliament defined the meaning of vegan for food labels in 2010, in force as of 2015.[109] Chain restaurants began marking vegan items on their menus and supermarkets improved their selection of vegan processed food.[110]

The global mock-meat market increased by 18 percent between 2005 and 2010,[111] and in the United States by eight percent between 2012 and 2015, to $553 million a year.[112] The Vegetarian Butcher (De Vegetarische Slager), the first known vegetarian butcher shop, selling mock meats, opened in the Netherlands in 2010,[111][113] while America's first vegan butcher, the Herbivorous Butcher, opened in Minneapolis in 2016.[112][114] Since 2017, more than 12,500 chain restaurant locations have begun offering Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods products including Carl’s Jr. outlets offering Beyond Burgers and Burger King outlets serving Impossible Whoppers. Plant-based meat sales in the U.S have grown 37% in the past two years.[115] By 2016, 49% of Americans were drinking plant milk, and 91% still drank dairy milk.[116] In the United Kingdom, the plant milk market increased by 155 percent in two years, from 36 million litres (63 million imperial pints) in 2011 to 92 million (162 million imperial pints) in 2013.[117] There was a 185% increase in new vegan products between 2012 and 2016 in the UK.[107] In 2011, Europe's first vegan supermarkets appeared in Germany: Vegilicious in Dortmund and Veganz in Berlin.[118][119]

In 2017, veganism rose in popularity in Hong Kong and China, particularly among millennials.[120] China's vegan market is estimated to rise by more than 17% between 2015 and 2020,[120][121] which is expected to be ""the fastest growth rate internationally in that period"".[120] This exceeds the projected growth in the second and third fastest-growing vegan markets internationally in the same period, the United Arab Emirates (10.6%) and Australia (9.6%) respectively.[121][122] In total, as of 2016, the largest share of vegan consumers globally currently reside in Asia Pacific with nine percent of people following a vegan diet.[121] In 2013, the Oktoberfest in Munich — traditionally a meat-heavy event — offered vegan dishes for the first time in its 200-year history.[123]"
"Meat, Milk, and Eggs Get Cheaper than Ever","Adjusted for inflation, the price of animal products dropped significantly thanks to the efficiencies gained through factory farming. This gave rise to people eating more meat, milk, and eggs than ever before—while animal welfare standards simultaneously collapsed. The cratering of welfare standards directly arose from the industry’s fierce competition to slash costs to the minimum. Thousands of meat, dairy, and egg producers quit business every year. The dairy industry offers a good example of the relentless financial pressure that animal farmers face. Beginning in 2013, dairies throughout the Northeast U.S. lost money four years in a row. In each of those years, wholesale milk prices came in well below production costs. Over that period, one regional dairy cooperative sent out suicide prevention letters after two of its members killed themselves. To stay afloat financially, meat, dairy, and egg producers must cut expenses wherever possible. Tragically, many of these cost-cutting measures are tremendously cruel."
Mutilations at Factory Farms,"Just as bullying and violence pervades poorly run schools and prisons, the same is true at factory farms. The staggering levels of crowding at factory farms cause the animals to take their frustrations out on one another. More crowding inevitably means more violence. The problem goes away if you remove stresses and provide adequate living space, but that solution is too expensive for most facilities to contemplate. Factory farms instead inflict a variety of mutilations onto the animals in order to keep them from injuring one another. Pigs raised in overcrowded conditions are apt to bite one another’s tails. At factory farms, workers cut the tails cut off and clip their “needle teeth.”

Hens crowded into battery cages can peck each other to death. So egg producers use a hot blade to sear off the pointy final third of their beaks—rendering it unlikely that a peck can draw blood. While a beak may appear woody on the outside, the hen’s mouth lies inside and full of nerve endings. So, the reality is that beak searing is a partial (and no doubt excruciatingly painful) amputation of the bird’s mouth. Some hens are unable to eat or drink after beak searing, and perish. Unlike pigs and chickens, cows don’t commonly attack one another when subjected to stress. But in overcrowded conditions, horns endanger both workers and other cattle, so they’re painfully amputated or sawed off. Ranchers also brand their cattle with a hot iron in order to deter theft. Dairy farmers usually cut off their cows’ tails so they don’t interfere with the milking machines. That leaves the cows with no way to shoo away flies, which are often legion at dairies and a constant source of misery.
In order to improve meat tenderness and also eliminate the “boar taint” stench in pork, farmers castrate nearly every male calf and piglet. I’ll spare you the details of how this is done, but interested readers can follow read this article or watch this video. Each of these mutilations, including castration, typically occurs without anesthesia. A local anesthetic would greatly reduce pain, but factory farm owners regard even the cheapest analgesics as prohibitively expensive."
Our teeth/digestive systems are designed for eating meat.,"No, they aren’t. We can digest meat, but our digestive systems are different to carnivorous animals: our guts are longer (so we can digest lots of plant materials) and our teeth are not designed to slice and tear flesh. Our teeth and mouths are the wrong shape to be able to kill and hold captive struggling prey (compare our jaw shape and teeth to a lion – or your pet cat or dog!). That’s why humans cook meat before eating it and why we’re no good at crunching and munching uncooked bones. As for our sharp teeth, gorillas are entirely vegan – as are almost all primates – and yet have far longer and sharper canine teeth than human beings. The diet of the ancestors of human beings was vegan until they began hunting about one-and-a-half million years ago but even then meat formed just a tiny part of their diet. That’s why people live long, healthy lives on vegan diets but would quickly die if they ate nothing but meat. To find out more, see our Nutrition Myths page or read our guides, Wheat Eaters or Meat Eaters and Your Health in Your Hands."
Pigs,"Every year in the UK, 10 million pigs are slaughtered for human consumption. Pigs have an average lifespan of 15 - 20 years, but reach slaughter rate at 6 months old. Less than 3% of UK pigs spend their entire lives outdoors. Most big slaughterhouses in the Britain and Europe kill pigs in gas chambers. Around half of all antibiotics sold in the UK are used on farmed animals, with 60% of these being used on pigs.  Most pigs are entitled to less than one square metre of space each and the majority of sows (female breeding pigs) are kept in farrowing crates. Farrowing crates were made illegal in several countries across Europe, but are still standard farming practice here in the UK. "
"Pregnancy, infants and children","The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada consider well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets ""appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes"".[269] The German Society for Nutrition cautioned against a vegan diet for pregnant women, breastfeeding women, babies, children, and adolescents.[28] The position of the Canadian Pediatric Society is that ""well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets with appropriate attention to specific nutrient components can provide a healthy alternative lifestyle at all stages of fetal, infant, child and adolescent growth. It is recommended that attention should be given to nutrient intake, particularly protein, vitamins B12 and D, essential fatty acids, iron, zinc, and calcium.[262]

According to a 2015 systematic review, there is little evidence available about vegetarian and vegan diets during pregnancy, and a lack of randomized studies meant that the effects of diet could not be distinguished from confounding factors.[270] It concluded: ""Within these limits, vegan-vegetarian diets may be considered safe in pregnancy, provided that attention is paid to vitamin and trace element requirements.""[270] A daily source of vitamin B12 is important for pregnant and lactating vegans, as is vitamin D if there are concerns about low sun exposure.[t] A different review found that pregnant vegetarians consumed less zinc than pregnant non-vegetarians, with both groups' intake below recommended levels; however, the review found no significant difference between groups in actual zinc levels in bodily tissues, nor any effect on gestation period or birth weight.[272]

Researchers have reported cases of vitamin B12 deficiency in lactating vegetarian mothers that were linked to deficiencies and neurological disorders in their children.[273][274] It is recommended that a doctor or registered dietitian should be consulted about taking supplements during pregnancy.[275][276]

Vegan diets have attracted negative attention from the media because of cases of nutritional deficiencies that have come to the attention of the courts, including the death of a baby in New Zealand in 2002 due to hypocobalaminemia, i.e. vitamin B12 deficiency.[34]"
Preventing Animal Slaughter,"If witnessing animal abuse and slaughter troubles you, only a vegan diet can eliminate every last bit of it. It may seem counter-intuitive, but the milk and egg industries are as tied to animal slaughter as the meat industry. In fact, the only difference between these industries is that meat comes from animals who have been killed, whereas milk and eggs come from animals who will be killed, guaranteed. It’s obvious that meat requires killing, but why are nearly all dairy cows and layer hens also sent to slaughter? It’s because, as cows and hens age, their production of milk and eggs sharply diminishes. At roughly a quarter of their natural lifespan, yields have so dramatically declined that these animals are no longer profitable. They’re sent to slaughter and replaced with younger, more productive ones.

Still more slaughter arises from the fact that dairies impregnate their cows annually in order to maximize milk production. This means that millions of baby calves are born each year, entirely as a byproduct of milk production. Many of these calves, and the vast majority of the males, are slaughtered when they are only days or weeks old. Slaughter is invariably gory and disturbing to witness. Animals are stunned as they step onto the kill floor. The methods used for stunning are as troubling to watch as the slaughter itself. The most common method for stunning cattle and pigs involves a “captive bolt” pistol. These pistols ram a rod through the animal’s forehead, causing a massive brain injury. Yet the pistols are designed not to kill the animal outright, in order for the animals’ heart to keep beating to pump blood from the body after the throat is slit.

There are other stunning methods as well, each flawed and troubling in their own way. Electric shocks commonly stun chickens and pigs prior to slaughter. These shocks are doubtless painful. And it’s almost impossible to calibrate these devices so that every animal will be rendered unconscious yet not outright killed. Some pigs are stunned with carbon dioxide, which inflicts severe distress and is profoundly disturbing to watch. Kosher and halal slaughterhouses don’t use any sort of stunning, since the animals must bleed to death while still conscious. This opens the door to all sorts of deeply disturbing slaughterhouse practices, as one hidden camera after another has revealed."
Selective Breeding,"Even when raised in good environments, farm animals commonly suffer a number of painful health problems. That’s because decades of selective breeding have boosted egg yields, milk yields, and growth rates to staggering extremes. These breeding advances make animal agribusiness more efficient and productive than ever, but the animals pay a terrible price.

When it comes to genetics, no animal is more revved up than chickens, and none suffers more as a result. Chickens raised for meat grow more than four times faster than birds raised in the 1950s.5 This rapid growth puts a severe strain on the birds’ cardiovascular system, and up to 4 percent of birds die from “sudden death syndrome.”6 In their brief lives, many of these chickens also suffer from debilitating leg problems brought on by their rapid growth rates. One large study found that more than 25 percent of chickens had trouble moving, with nearly 4 percent, “almost unable to walk.”7 At farms that raise chickens for meat, it is common to find birds with broken legs. Unable to walk to food or water, they die of thirst or starve to death. No one notices their plight or pauses to provide care—a chicken who is going to die anyway isn’t worth the added labor costs.

Just like every human pregnancy carries risk, complications can arise every time a hen lays an egg. So the more intensive the breeding to increase egg productivity, the greater the chances that something will go wrong. Modern hens frequently suffer a “prolapse” while laying their eggs. Here, the egg becomes stuck to the hen’s internal organs. During laying, reproductive and digestive organs can come out along with the egg. Without prompt veterinary attention, infection will set in and the bird will die. Since the requisite veterinary care costs at least twenty times the value of a replacement hen, none of these afflicted birds get the treatment they need to survive. In typical egg-laying sheds that house tens of thousands of hens, it is unlikely they will be noticed at all. Nearly all hens afflicted with a severe prolapse will suffer a lingering death from blood loss or infection. In many cases, they take their dying breaths trampled by cage-mates while lying pressed against a wire battery cage floor. In the United States alone, millions of hens each year die in this manner as a result of prolapses and other conditions.8

Dairy cows likewise suffer a variety of maladies as a result of selective breeding. Today’s cows may look the same as yesterday’s, but they produce over four times more milk per animal than did cows from 1950.9 There are many health problems attributable to these extreme milk yields, the most common of which is an inflammation of the udders, which is generally accompanied by infection. In cows with infected udders, the number of somatic cells in the milk increases dramatically. Laypeople have a more plainspoken word for “somatic cells.” That word is “pus.”

Thanks to their massive milk yields, udder inflammation and sub-clinical infection are widespread among modern dairy cows. So if you want to ensure your milk contains no pus, you must choose a plant-based variety like soy milk."
Sheep,"Around 1.4 million sheep and goats are killed without being stunned each year in the UK using halal practices. Many people in the UK oppose this form of slaughter, yet purchase halal meat unknowingly, since it is sold in most major outlets, including supermarkets and takeaways, without always being labelled as halal. Every year around 4 million newborn lambs die within a few days of birth, mainly because of malnutrition, disease or exposure to cold weather. Male lambs are castrated using elastration, a technique that involves a thick rubber band being placed around the base of the infant’s scrotum, obstructing the blood supply and causing atrophy. This method causes severe pain to the lambs who are provided no pain relief during the process. Lambs also have their tails docked using the same method."
Speciesism,"A few key concepts reside at the core of animal rights philosophy. Perhaps the most important of these relates to speciesism. This word applies to the attempts to justify exploitation on the basis of an animal’s species. Such justifications inevitably ignore facts of far greater relevance. The question of whether rights are unjustly violated should start by evaluating each individual animal’s ability (or lack thereof) to think, feel, and suffer. Speciesism is fundamentally irrational, and yet once you start looking for it you can see it everywhere. Perhaps the most obvious example relates to the fact that, by all accounts, pigs are more intelligent than dogs. Yet the pork industry’s standard farming practices would yield a stream of felony cruelty convictions if it raised dogs in the same manner. It’s readily apparent that speciesism is cut from the same cloth as other sorts of rights violations. How does racism, sexism, classism, and so forth relate to speciesism? All of these “isms” violate an individual’s liberties on grounds that are fundamentally arbitrary. The only thing that sets speciesism apart from the others is that it offers an excuse to exploit certain types of animals rather than certain groups of people."
The Cruelty of Factory Farming,"Animal advocates use the term, “factory farming” to refer to the dominant methods of animal farming used in industrialized countries. While there are important differences between how cattle, pigs, and poultry are kept, all of these animals are commonly raised at factory farms. Prior to World War II, most farm animals lived under comparatively good conditions on small, family-owned farms. These animals typically received plenty of space, and they often had access to sunlight and fresh air. So, by any standard they had the makings of a decent life even if this life was destined to be violently cut short. Farmers of that era didn’t necessarily supply the animals with satisfactory living conditions out of the goodness of their hearts, they did it because mortality rates surged to unprofitable levels when their animals’ basic living needs weren’t met.2 The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl era saw massive changes in America’s system of agriculture. Land grant colleges across the United States pioneered an entirely new form of farming both crops and animals. Starting in the 1920s, agriculture colleges at these state colleges began teaching agriculture with the same rigor applied to any other academic discipline. And as a new generation of farmers became exposed to disciplines like chemistry and biology, everything about plant and animal farming changed. The petrochemical-based “Green Revolution” that occurred between the 1930s and 1960s boosted crop yields, arguably raising standards of living worldwide while averting numerous famines. But within animal agriculture, the introduction of factory farming methods simultaneously increased animal suffering to unconscionable extremes."
The Virtues of Plant-Based Diets,"You can view a vegan diet either in terms of what it excludes or what it includes. Vegan diets exclude all foods produced by or derived from animals: meat, fish, dairy products, eggs, and honey. Alternately, another way to look at veganism is that it’s a manner of eating that is based entirely on plants. Many vegans go beyond diet to exclude animal use from every aspect of their lifestyle. They’ll avoid clothing made of wool and won’t buy a leather sofa. When purchasing cosmetics they’ll steer clear of products tested on animals or that contain animal ingredients. While there are excellent reasons to take such steps, to keep this essay short I will focus entirely on food.
Millions of people who have carefully examined animal agribusiness have resolved to go vegan. But even if you decide a vegan diet isn’t for you, you’ll probably come away from reading this essay sold on the benefits of eating what people now call a “plant-based” diet. Why am I so sure? Because the reasons to choose a diet that is at least mostly plant-based are so overwhelming that there really aren’t any credible counterarguments. That may explain why the most prominent food politics writers—including Michael Pollan, Mark Bittman, and Eric Schlosser—advocate a diet based heavily on plants.

Plant-based diets deliver many of the benefits of being vegan while requiring only the slightest effort. Since you haven’t devoted yourself to being 100 percent anything, there’s no reason to worry that you’ll cheat, slip, or screw up. You can follow a plant-based diet and still eat Thanksgiving turkey or a summer barbecue. If being 100 percent vegan is something people commit to, being plant-based is more something they lean into.

Maybe the best thing about the plant-based concept is that it often sets in motion a “virtuous cycle,” where one positive change leads to another and then to another. When you regularly try new vegan foods, your favorites tend to automatically become part of your everyday diet. So as time goes by, your diet will likely move in a vegan direction without any concerted effort on your part. Plenty of current vegans got there by gradually sliding down the plant-based slope. Over time spent eating increasing amounts of plant-based foods, they realized that they were just a few small and easy steps away from becoming totally vegan. There are a number of cute and helpful neologisms attached to the plant-based camp: reducetarian, flexitarian, chegan, plant-strong, and even veganish. If any of these terms resonates with you, just grab ahold of it and start thinking along those lines as you begin trying more vegetarian and vegan meals.

Additionally, there are several other related concepts you may find helpful, including: Meatless Mondays, Mark Bittman’s Vegan Before 6:00 plan, or taking an entirely vegan diet out for a 21-day test drive. All of these possibilities can inspire significant change without imposing requirements for lifelong perfection. Of the many reasons to go plant-based, perhaps the best of all is the lack of a sensible counterargument. In all my years writing about food politics, I’ve never once seen anyone (other than a few paleo diet fanatics) make a serious attempt to argue against eating mostly plants, since the advantages are undeniable. Dozens and dozens of studies show that eating more fruits and vegetables can dramatically decrease rates of cancer, diabetes, and circulatory disease. And of course, plant-based diets also keep farm animals from slaughter, while simultaneously protecting the environment."

Dairy cows have been bred to produce up to 10 times more milk than they naturally would. Male calves are of no use to the dairy industry and are less suitable for beef production. This means that every year around 95,000 male dairy calves are shot soon after birth and discarded as a by-product. 
Domesticated cows have an average lifespan of 20 years, but on dairy farms they are killed after 5-6 years on average.

51% of eggs produced come from chickens in battery cages.
40 million day-old male chicks are killed in the UK by either being gassed or being thrown into a macerator - this practice occurs in all egg farming systems, including organic and free-range.
Beak trimming is the permanent removal of part of the beak of a bird at a young age. This is standard industry practice in the UK despite being illegal in many European countries due to the pain it inflicts.
A free-range egg farmer can legally house 16,000 birds in one building, meaning that they can house 9 birds per square metre of space. This means that free-range hens live out their entire lives in an overcrowded indoor farming unit.

According to the Higg Materials Sustainability Index, leather from cows is nearly three times as harmful to the environment as vegan leather, and wool is twice as harmful as polyester. Source 
The sustainability argument is often misrepresented as people think that just because something is made of plastic, it automatically must be the least environmentally friendly option; in fact, when you consider how much it takes to stop a piece of cow skin from decomposing, animal leather is right at the bottom of the sustainable materials list. Many people forget to factor in how much water and food the cows consume, how much land they take up, how much waste and methane they produce, and the amount of chemicals used in the tannery industry that harm its workers.
Humans around the world drink 5.2 billion gallons of water and eat 21 billion pounds of food each day. Cows around the world drink 45 billion gallons of water and eat 135 billion pounds of food each day - nine times as much water and seven times as much food as all humans. Source

We’ve eaten meat since we were cavemen,"We’ve lied, stolen, killed one another and made war since we were cavemen too. That doesn’t make those things right too."
What about medicine?,Medicines prescribed by doctors are normally first tested on non-human animals. This is unavoidable under current laws. What you can do is ask your doctor for medicines that possibly don't contain animal ingredients. Medicines usually come with an information leaflet listing the ingredients. Ask your pharmacist for advice too.
What about products that have items such as eggs and dairy listed as ‘May contain traces of…’?,"This is something that you will have to make your own decision on. ‘May contain traces of…’ generally means that the product in question is made on the same production line, or in the same factory as others which do contain those ingredients. The wording is generally there as a disclaimer in case someone has an allergy to that particular ingredient (you’ll usually find that it is only allergens that are listed, eg. eggs, dairy, seafood and peanuts).

The chance of the product containing that item is generally very small, and if it did, the amount would most likely be a minute quantity."
What can I use instead of cow’s milk?,"There is a wide variety of non-dairy milks available. Your local supermarket is likely to stock the more common items such as soy, almond and rice milks, and many health food shops, organic stores and Asian supermarkets offer less common ones such as nut, oat, quinoa and hemp milks. These products can be found both on the shelf and in the refrigerated sections."
What difference will one person giving up meat make?,"A huge difference. The average British meat eater consumes, in the course of their lifetime, 5 cattle, 20 pigs, 29 sheep and lambs, 780 chickens, 46 turkeys, 18 ducks, 7 rabbits, 1, geese and half-a-tonne of fish. That is a lot of lives saved. Just as importantly, the best advertisement for veganism is a healthy and happy vegan: if you turn vegan you will be able to influence others to become part of the movement towards a more compassionate and rational world."
What does the word ‘vegan’ really mean?,"In recent years, the word ‘vegan’ has come a long way from the relative obscurity in which it once dwelled. As a concept now associated with people as well known as Oprah, Bill Clinton and James Cameron, the word itself has become fairly widely known. But is it really understood?

Contrary to popular belief, vegans do not just subscribe to a plant-based diet or abstain from animal products as a reaction to the treatment of animals in large-scale, industrialized conditions. Vegans object to our use of animals as “resources” in and of itself, whether the individuals in question are being housed in factories, or in small, backyard, family-farm situations.

This includes (but is not limited to) the use of animals for food, clothing, cosmetics, experimentation and entertainment. It also extends to any situation where animals are being used for labor such as in the case of oxen tilling fields, and any situation where animals are treated as commodities such as in the pet industry, which treats ‘companion animals’ as living merchandise to be bought and sold. (Note: Vegans, as a whole, do not object to the practice of sharing one’s home with animals. Many of us take tremendous joy in being able to adopt or rescue the unwanted refugees of the pet trade.)

Vegans do not use or wear leather, wool, silk, down, fur, or any other fabric that come from animals. Nor do we ingest milk, honey, eggs, flesh, or any other ingredients of animal origin, including ‘by-products’, such as gelatin and casein. We also abstain from using cosmetics, toiletries and (as far as is practical) pharmaceutical products that are made using animal ingredients or animal testing. We also do not support or condone any form of ‘entertainment’ that involves the use of animals, including (but not limited to) circuses, rodeos, marine parks, zoos/safaris, animal racing, and hunting."
What is a vegan?,"Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. Vegans avoid eating all foods of animal origin: meat, fish, dairy products, eggs, and honey. Veganism was originally defined purely as a dietary choice, but many vegans extend this ethic to shun animal testing and ingredients from all things they consume or wear, including clothing, shoes, personal care items, cosmetics, and medicine."
What is wrong with eating dairy products?,"Many people do not realise the cruelty involved in the dairy industry. A cow, like a human, only produces milk when she has a baby to feed. Dairy cows are therefore forced to produce calf after calf, each of whom are taken from her shortly after birth, in order to keep her producing milk. The stress placed on the cow often results in her being killed as young as 7 years old (in Australia), when her natural lifespan is between 20-25 years.

The female calves of these cows often replace other members of the dairy herd, whereas the male calves are an unwanted product of the industry. They are either raised for veal or killed shortly after birth. Not only is dairy unethical, it is also unhealthy as it is high in saturated fat and cholesterol and is linked to obesity, heart disease, cancer, diabetes and osteoporosis. Dairy can also cause Iron deficiency anaemia in infants and toddlers. For further information on the dairy industry go to cowtruth.com"
What would happen to the countryside if we stopped having animals grazing on it?,"As we’ve already seen, we would need to use less of our countryside for agriculture if we were all vegan: that means that more of it could return to a natural state. Britain has less woodland than any other northern European country – we could change that if we didn’t need to use land to grow crops like soya and rape for animal feed. Far from being a loss to the countryside as some people imagine, ending livestock farming would mean a huge toll of suffering would be eliminated and wildlife allowed to recover"
Where do you get your protein?,"Not so long ago, conventional wisdom had it that vegans and vegetarians would inevitably develop dangerous protein deficiencies. But over time this myth has largely died out, doubtless due to the fact that have been virtually no instances of vegans dropping dead from lack of protein.



Unfortunately, a harmful counter-myth has arisen within the vegan world: that plant-based foods are so loaded with protein that vegans need never give the topic a thought. That’s an unreasonable belief that has set a lot of vegans up for inadequate protein intake, even if they’ll never be hospitalized for deficiency. Protein is a vital nutrient and falling short of your needs is harmful in a variety of ways. So it’s worth making sure you’re incorporating several rich sources of protein into your everyday diet. Here are some protein-rich vegan foods that will help ensure your needs are met."
Why do vegans always look ill?,"They don’t. That’s like asking why toupees always look bad – it’s just that you only notice the bad ones. If you know someone (who knows someone...) who was ill they do not represent vegans! People like Novak Djokovic, Martin Shaw, Venus Williams, Natalie Portman, Liam Hemsworth, Pamela Anderson, Joanna Lumley and Carl Lewis, winner of 6 Olympic Gold medals, look pretty good on their vegan diets. And you should see the Viva! staff - we’re like gods and goddesses here..."
Why don’t you care about people? They are more important than animals.,Being vegan IS caring about people. A vegan diet benifits human health and reduces community medical costs. Animals farmed for ‘food’ eat huge amounts of plants and prains that could be fed to starving humans instead
Why Go Beyond Plant-Based?,"Now that we’ve touched on the benefits of eating mostly plant-based foods, let’s consider the advantages of going further and becoming vegan. This raises the key question: what does a vegan diet give you that a plant-based diet can’t? It turns out that going vegan has several advantages no other diet can match. If you find yourself swayed by the arguments for becoming vegetarian or for moving in a plant-based direction, you should know that most of those arguments apply even more forcefully to becoming vegan. The great virtue of vegan foods is that they slam the door shut on so many disagreeable things, especially where animal suffering is concerned. So as we begin digging into the why go vegan question, let’s start by looking at farm animals. More than 70 billion farm animals are slaughtered each year, the vast majority of whom are kept under extraordinarily cruel conditions. And when it comes to inflicting animal suffering, it turns out that the dairy and egg industries are every bit as objectionable as the meat industry. A vegan diet cuts out this exploitation, and prevents your food budget from funding animal abuse and slaughter."
Why Go Vegan for Your Health?,"While no diet can guarantee a long and healthy life, becoming vegan may improve your odds. That’s largely because a vegan diet eliminates a number of unhealthful foods, including red and cured meats—two foods strongly linked to colon cancer.12 Vegans also tend to eat far more vegetables and fruits than non-vegetarians. Studies consistently show that people who eat the most fruits and vegetables tend to enjoy better health.13 Research also suggests that vegans suffer lower rates of heart disease and diabetes.14 This reduced risk is partly due to the fact that vegans are statistically leaner and much less prone to obesity than the general population, but this isn’t the whole explanation. Additional benefits probably arise from low saturated fat intake and from the healthful compounds in plant foods.

The Potential Benefits of Ditching Dairy: A surprisingly large number of vegans will tell you that quitting dairy changed their lives. Milk products may cause all sorts of chronic health ailments, from nasal congestion to acne to migraines to digestive problems. Many people suffer from these conditions for decades, yet never suspect that dairy products are to blame. I can personally attest to the health benefits that can accompany going dairy-free. My lifelong severe nasal congestion vanished forever within weeks of eliminating milk products from my diet.

Vegan Diets Support High Levels of Fitness: Some people fret that a vegan diet might impede serious athletic training, but that’s not a valid concern. A well-planned vegan diet can in fact support the highest levels of fitness. Both Rich Roll and Scott Jurek, two of the world’s most acclaimed ultra-endurance athletes, are long-time vegans. But what about sports that require strength and bulk? Here too, examples of elite vegan athletes abound. And in 2018, fifteen members of the Tennessee Titans switched to a vegan diet.

Antibiotics in Factory Farming: In addition to the personal health benefits associated with a vegan diet, there are substantial public health benefits as well. That’s because large industrialized meat and dairy farms burden society with all sorts of hidden costs. One of the greatest of these relates to the incubation of new strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Through its lobbying efforts carried out alongside the pharmaceutical industry, the meat industry has for decades gotten away with using staggering amounts of antibiotics. A small portion of these important antibiotics are administered to farm animals in order to treat severe infections. But most of these antibiotics go to healthy animals in order to improve feed-to-meat conversion rates, and to prevent diseases associated with overcrowding.

In the United States, farm animals are responsible for something like 70 percent of all antibiotic use. Despite the well-known risks of antibiotic overuse, this percentage has been steadily increasing for years.15 Worldwide, the meat and dairy industries combine to use more than 100,000 tons of antibiotics per year.16 Many of these antibiotics, like penicillin and tetracyclines, have irreplaceable uses in human medicine. Confining thousands of animals in one space and dosing them all with antibiotics inevitably increases microbial resistance. This in turn renders important classes of antibiotics ineffective for urgent human medical needs. It’s difficult to pin the emergence of a lethal antibiotic-resistant strain of microbes on a specific animal farm. But there’s no legitimate doubt that animal agriculture is a main culprit behind the emergence of deadly antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria like the MRSA superbug. Tragically, lobbyists from the meat and pharmaceutical industries have long stymied efforts to restrict agriculture’s use of antibiotics. By rejecting meats sold by farms that use antibiotics, we can each send a message and avoid contributing to the problem."
Why go vegan?,"A vegan lifestyle prevents a tremendous amount of animal slaughter and suffering. It offers a potent way to shrink our environmental footprint, especially in regard to climate change. And a well-planned vegan diet can fuel the highest levels of fitness, while reducing our risk of various chronic diseases. Plus, the food is insanely delicious and it becomes more widely available every year."
Why not do something for people instead of animals?,"Veganism does help people. The meat industry causes environmental degradation through things like deforestation, soil erosion, water pollution and the production of greenhouse gases – we would live in a cleaner, better world if we were all vegan. Secondly, because meat production is such an inefficient way of producing food it consumes resources which should go to human beings. In the developing world, land is increasingly being devoted to the production of animal fodder for export to the rich world instead of being used to grow food for the local population. Finally, veganism improves human health, which brings rewards for individuals and also to society as a whole which needs to spend less on health care and lost working days through ill health. Compassion towards animals is not in competition with compassion towards people. Veganism is a choice each individual can make which improves the lives of animals and human beings. It is also a choice about what people eat – not where they work, what they do in their spare time or how they vote. Many vegans dedicate their lives to human welfare – Gandhi is the classic example of that."
Why Not Just Avoid Factory Farmed Foods?,"Unless specifically labeled to the contrary, you can assume that every animal product came from a factory farm. As we’ve seen, every sort of cruelty is rampant at these places. A number of omnivores have pushed back against factory farm cruelties by demanding higher animal welfare standards. Most natural foods stores and supermarkets sell specially-labeled animal products from farms that promise better animal welfare. Additionally, many small-scale meat and egg producers rent stalls at local farmers’ markets. At their best, alternative farms deliver genuine improvements over factory farms. That’s mainly because they refuse to partake in the cruelest farming practices, particularly with regard to confinement and crowding. And with this reduced crowding, mutilations like beak searing and tail-clipping can be eliminated. That’s because animals unstressed by crowding are far less likely to attack or bully one another.

Unfortunately, the substantial price premium these higher welfare foods command can exert an overpowering temptation on producers to cheat. All too often, farmers exaggerate or outright lie about standards for animal care. Just like at factory farms, every alternative producer faces the strongest financial temptation to push limits. Since the costs of delivering genuinely good animal welfare are so high, there are always farmers willing to cut corners. The reality is that some so-called “organic” farms are factory farms in every sense of the word. Sure, they use higher quality animal feed and refrain from using antibiotics, but animal welfare remains deplorable. At one point, several of America’s largest “organic” dairies exploited a regulatory loophole that allowed them to keep their cows confined indoors 310 days out of every year. In late 2017, the Trump administration threw out regulations that had required organic poultry and livestock producers to provide their animals sufficient space to spread their wings or turn around."
Will I need to supplement calcium if I don’t eat dairy?,"Not necessarily, you can get an adequate amount of calcium from a vegan diet. Good sources of calcium include green leafy vegetables, baked beans, black beans, dried figs, tahini and almonds. As well as this most plant milks are fortified with calcium too. In Australia the recommended calcium intake for adults ranges from 1000 to 1300 mg of calcium per day.

Vitamin D assists the absorption of calcium in the body. A reliable source of Vitamin D is approximately 15 minutes of unprotected exposure to the sun each day. Though vitamin D supplements are recommended for many non-vegans and vegans alike, especially during the winter months."
"You don’t have to kill animals to get dairy and eggs, so what’s wrong with those products?","When it comes to killing, the only difference from eggs and dairy products is that while meat comes from an animal who has been slaughtered, milk and eggs come from animals who will be slaughtered. Guaranteed. Every dairy cow and egg-laying hen inevitably goes to slaughter (unless they die prematurely from disease).

Milk and eggs have one major thing in common: they’re the reproductive products of young females. As cows and chickens age, their milk and egg yields decline markedly. In consequence, nearly all dairy cows and layer hens are sent to slaughter at less than half their natural life expectancy; replaced by younger animals who will also in turn be slaughtered when their yields decline.

Add to this that the America’s egg industry breeds more than 200 million replacement hens every year, and that it’s standard practice for dairy cows to be kept pregnant nine months out of every year. What happens to the males born in these systems? Male chicks are unwanted since, being of the egg-laying variety, they can’t profitably be raised for meat. These animals are generally ground up alive, or smothered within hours of hatching. Male calves produced by the dairy industry likewise have little value. Some are sold for a pittance to veal farms, while others are slaughtered immediately upon birth.

These dark realities tend to be true regardless of whether we’re talking about the worst factory farms, or the best free-range egg farms and organic dairies."
