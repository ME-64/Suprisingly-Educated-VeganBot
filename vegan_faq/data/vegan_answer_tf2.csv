0,Where do vegans get their protein? Do you get enough protein?,"Getting enough protein is not actually as hard as people will make you think. What people don’t realise is that protein is in virtually everything we eat! Plus most adults need only about 50g a day but consume considerably more than this.
Great vegan sources of protein include, tofu, tempeh, seitan, lentils, chickpeas, beans, nuts and seeds.

1,Are free range eggs bad?,"Most free range laying hens live in crowded sheds. Their outside area is generally restricted to a small enclosure with access via small exit holes which many hens are unable to reach and therefore have no outside access. The ones who do go outside are sometime trapped outside to be picked off by foxes. Hens can have a lifespan of 10 years, however they are often killed after 18 months when their productivity drops. Free range laying hens are the offspring of parent birds who are kept for their entire lives inside crowded, filthy sheds with no access to the outside. The hens and roosters are housed together for constant mating. The hens have no escape or respite from the roosters, their backs become featherless, red and sore from when roosters mount them. The female chicks of these parent birds are sent to free range, barn laid or caged sheds. The males are unwanted by-products and are killed soon after hatching, generally by being ground up alive in a macerator."
2,can vegans eat fish?,"I don’t want to state the obvious but… fish aren’t vegetables! Even though they are very different from us, they are still living and breathing sentient beings who experience suffering and pain, and they are not food."
3,Don't cows need to be milked though?,"A cow only needs to be milked because she had her calf taken away from her within a day or two of birth. The calf gets a cheap replacement formula generally made from slaughterhouse plasma and vitamins. Perhaps this strikes you as an unfair deal all the way around. And in a few months, after the cow’s milk yields peak, she’ll be re-impregnated once again to start the whole cycle all over. For more details, check out our page on dairy cows.

All in all, it’s a terrible life for these animals, especially the cows who live on “dry lot” dairies who are confined in crowded sheds. Disease is common, especially mastitis—an infection of the udders brought on by the enormous milk yields of modern-day dairy cows.

Luckily, it’s never been easier to go dairy-free. Excellent vegan versions of traditional dairy products are abundant and easy to find. Most groceries today carry soy, rice, and almond milk. And you can find excellent vegan cheese and ice cream at any natural foods store, and in better supermarkets. It’s also easy to find non-dairy yogurts, margarine, and even coffee creamer. Look for all these products in the dairy case."
4,Do animals suffer?,"Animals have the same evolutionary past as us and the same reporting mechanisms for pain that we do; a brain and central nervous system. They also produce the same reactions in scenarios where pain would arise; they flinch and make noises of distress. There’s strong evidence too that animals experience mental suffering. In stressful situations vertebrates have been found to release adrenally-derived glucocorticoid hormones which “drive gluconeogenesis, suppress reproductive processes, alter movement and feeding rates, impact immune functions, and generally help an individual enter a ‘state of emergency’ when an environmental stressor induces their release”. Fish too, for example, “experience a rise in cortisol” (commonly known as the stress hormone) when confronted with factors capable of producing fear. There is even evidence that animals can experience mental illnesses just as we do."
5,Do plants suffer?,"Plants have input and output reactions to certain stimulation, for example photosynthesis, but they can’t experience pain or mental suffering due to not having a brain or central nervous system. Being vegan actually reduces the number of plants eaten because the animals we eat have to be fed on vast quantities of plants. Producing a kilogram of beef requires 25 kilograms of grain, one kilogram of pork requires nine kilograms of grain and one kilogram of chicken requires three kilograms of grain. This is also why the argument that eating meat is better than being vegan because more insects and small animals are killed in plant agriculture does not hold."
6,"Does producing milk, cheese and eggs cause suffering?","These processes indeed cause great suffering to animals. Mother cows need to be pregnant to produce milk so from 15 months old they are forced into confined spaces every two or three months and artificially impregnated. After birth, the calf is removed from the mother within 36 hours; if the calf is male, he will likely be sold to be raised for veal or if there isn’t enough demand, he will be shot. The Drum reported in 2012 that 90,000 male calves are shot dead each year for this reason. If the calf is female, she will often be prepared to be a mother calf.Normally, a cow holds at most two litres of milk in her udder but the antibiotics farmers use for optimum milk production cause cows to carry 20 litres at any one time. The weight of this often makes cows lame or causes painful inflammation of the mammary glands (mastitis). Cows naturally live for up to 25 years but after 5 years of producing milk in these conditions their yield will no longer be profitable and they are slaughtered. In egg production, whether free range or not, hens have their beak painfully trimmed to prevent them injuring other hens due to the stress of confinement. They also experience a pre-mature death at around 80 weeks, when their natural life span is up to 8 years. Caged hens never see daylight and are restricted to space only slightly larger than a sheet of A4 paper. Male chicks are an unnecessary by-product of this process and are killed straight after hatching by incineration or gassing.   "
7,Does vegan food taste good?,"Yes it does! Our culture is all that limits us in eating an amazing selection of delicious vegan foods. We are increasingly programmed to eat highly processed and animal based diets. It is so much easier these days with plenty of vegan products and recipes available, and more coming into the market all the time"
8,Don’t we need some animal products in our diet to be healthy?,"For those who might be concerned about meeting all their nutritional requirements with just plant foods, rest assured that even the mainstream and conservative Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the American Dietetic Association, and described by www.eatright.org as “the world’s largest organization of food and nutrition professionals”) confirms that you do not need to eat animal products to maintain your health.

“It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life-cycle including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood and adolescence and for athletes.

Many people who become vegan report that their health greatly improves as a result. Perhaps, the lighter, healthier body that emerges with veganism is a reflection of a lighter, healthier conscience that comes with taking a stand against injustice and making a commitment to non-violence.

Finally, unlike the Atkins, Paleo, or South Beach diets, which are trendy fads, veganism is neither a fad nor a diet, but a stand against injustice and commitment to non-violence that impacts one’s eating choices because of ethical considerations. Nevertheless, the growing number of strong, active vegans are a testament to the fact that one doesn’t have to sacrifice one’s physical health to embrace a more gentle way of life."
9,What is environmental veganism?,"Environmental vegans focus on conservation, rejecting the use of animal products on the premise that fishing, hunting, trapping and farming, particularly factory farming, are environmentally unsustainable. This specific form of veganism focuses its way of living on how to have a sustainable way of life without consuming animals."
10,What is ethical veganism?,"Ethical veganism, also known as moral veganism, is based on opposition to speciesism, the assignment of value to individuals on the basis of (animal) species membership alone."
11,What is moral veganism?,"Ethical veganism, also known as moral veganism, is based on opposition to speciesism, the assignment of value to individuals on the basis of (animal) species membership alone."
12,We evolved to eat meat? It's natural,"There’s no doubt that at many times in history, especially during periods of war and famine, the ability for people to eat meat helped ensure their survival. Likewise, there are some parts of the world today where local populations depend of fish, poultry, or livestock for protein and calories. That’s because marginal lands that won’t support agriculture can often still support the grazing of livestock, and some coastal areas have insufficient land for farming but access to substantial amounts of fish.

That said, few people living in developed countries can credibly claim that their survival depends on animal products. In terms of nutrition, there’s nothing in animal products that isn’t readily available from a well-planned vegan diet.

And if we were really intent on feeding the world, we would stop feeding a huge portion of the worldwide grain crop to livestock (which entails massive food waste), and instead grow grains for human consumption."
13,How hard is it to really become a vegan?,"Nearly every single vegan you ask will tell you the transition was much easier than they expected. While becoming vegan may sound difficult right now, you’ll no doubt be shocked by how easy this is, especially if you take the time to read up on the topic."
14,Are vegan diets really good for the environment?,"Raising animals for meat, milk, and dairy production wastes resources and damages the environment on a massive scale. When fed to farm animals, a substantial portion of the calories and nutrients present in grains is turned to manure. This manure invariably pollutes local water supplies and chokes rivers and other bodies of water. Worse yet, the meat and dairy industries are now recognized as a leading contributor to climate change.
"
15,Do vegans get enough vitamin B12?,"Vegans can get B12 through fortified soy milk, marmite and savoury yeast flakes. B12 has also been added to some other vegan products (eg. some Sanitarium burgers, sausages and ice ‘creams’ – check labels though as some Sanitarium products contain eggs and dairy).

We recommend that vegans take a B12 supplement as any B12 present in plant foods is not easily absorbed into the body. It is important to also realise B12 is usually supplemented into ‘livestock’ animals diets too, so there is no ‘natural’ way for getting B12 in today’s society."
16,If we all went vegan – wouldn't all the animals die out?,"It's true that the number of animals will fall as farmers breed fewer and fewer animals as the years go by. Farmed animals live a controlled, distorted life, often filled with pain and fear. The vast majority of farmed animals are kept in indoor units where they never see the light of day. Those that are kept outside are only kept alive for a fraction of their natural lifespans before being slaughtered for meat - often in the most barbaric manner imaginable. All farmed animals are born to die at our command - a disgusting idea.  In a vegan world animals would not be kept for profit and greed but would be allowed to exist in their natural state and live their life in freedom."
17,"If we all went vegan, we’d be overrun with animals?","Farmed animals are not allowed to reproduce naturally and farmers only breed animals when they can make a profit out of doing so. As demand for meat goes down over time, so fewer and fewer animals will be bred. That means that we will not be overrun by millions of farmed animals, as some people seem to imagine. Eventually, the few that are left can be allowed to go free: pigs can root around in woodlands as it is natural for them to do, sheep will graze the hillsides like deer and so on. Their populations will find their own natural levels, just like every other animal."
18,"If you were stuck on a desert island, would you eat meat?","Maybe – but if you were stuck on a desert island you might have to run around naked, never take a shower and wipe your bottom with leaves: that doesn’t mean that you should do those things the rest of the time."
19,Is alcohol vegan?,"Most spirits are vegan, although there are the more obvious ones that contain cream or honey that are not. Most wines and beers go through a filtering process, often using animal products. Such filtering agents include milk, albumen (from eggs), isinglass (from the swim bladders of fish) and gelatine. Labelling regulations require allergens such as milk and egg to be listed on labels, but it is not a requirement for isinglass or gelatine. Coopers, Boags and Heineken beers are all vegan. While almost all German (and Belgian) beers are vegan because of their laws for purity!"
20,Is honey vegan?,"Honey is an animal product and is therefore avoided by vegans. Surprisingly, a lot of bees are factory farmed and live in unnatural conditions. The queen is often artificially inseminated, has her wings clipped and is replaced (killed) after 1 or 2 years (normal life span is around 5 years). Try using agave nectar, maple syrup or golden syrup instead."
21,Is it more expensive?,"Being vegan needn’t be more expensive than a diet containing animal products. Some of the cheapest and healthiest foods available are great staples of a vegan diet, including cereals, beans, rice, potatoes, lentils, pasta, bread, fruits and vegetables. If you’re eating a balanced diet that includes animal products, you likely already buy and enjoy many of these anyway. Some vegan items such as vegan milks and cheese can be more expensive than their non-vegan counterparts, but this additional outlay is likely to be balanced by the savings you make through not having to buy meat."
22,"Is it possible to really be vegan, when animal ingredients are everywhere?","Although it’s true that in today’s world, it is almost impossible to avoid using some non-vegan items or ingredients, it is also true that avoiding most of them is easier than you think. The rising number of vegans each year has created an increased demand for vegan products. So much so that today, there are many incredibly delicious, easily attainable, and easy to prepare substitutes that would have seemed miraculous to vegan pioneers, such as pizza and ice cream! "
23,Is palm oil vegan?,"In itself, palm oil is a vegetable product which does not need to involve the (ab)use of animals, and therefore is suitable for vegans. The palm oil and palm timber industries are rife with very bad practices. In the EU, palm oil used in food must now be labelled, but ingredients derived from palm oil in food and non-food products still do not have to be labelled."
24,Is veganism healthy?,"Well-planned vegan diets contain all the nutrients we need to remain healthy. The British Dietetic Association (BDA) is the professional association for dietitians in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The BDA recognises that well-planned vegan diets can support healthy living in people of all ages. It's always a great idea to pay attention to nutritional needs, but this applies to everyone, not just vegans. Going vegan is great opportunity to pay more attention to your diet and health. The"
25,Isn’t it expensive to be vegan?,"There’s plenty of cheap yet high-quality vegan food out there, and the trick to finding it all is learning how to shop effectively. Once you learn a few basic shopping tips, it’s actually easier to eat an affordable vegan diet than one that contains animal products. The key to being vegan on the cheap is to buy unprocessed foods in bulk. Every good natural foods store has a bulk section where you can buy everything from beans to grains to nuts to granola. If you can keep most of your purchases to items costing under $3 a pound your grocery bill will be remarkably low."
26,It’s alright to eat animals if they’ve had a good life?,"Would it be alright to kill and eat people if they’d had a good life? And what do we mean by a ‘good’ life, anyway? In the case of animals, we certainly don’t mean a long one. ‘Meat’ animals are killed as babies in the case of lambs and veal calves or as soon as they become physically mature – the equivalent of human teenagers - and never get to lead any kind of adult life. Animals, of course, want to live just as much as we do. "
27,What about medicine? Is medicine vegan?,Medicines prescribed by doctors are normally first tested on non-human animals. This is unavoidable under current laws. What you can do is ask your doctor for medicines that possibly don't contain animal ingredients. Medicines usually come with an information leaflet listing the ingredients. Ask your pharmacist for advice too.
28,What can I use instead of cow’s milk?,"There is a wide variety of non-dairy milks available. Your local supermarket is likely to stock the more common items such as soy, almond and rice milks, and many health food shops, organic stores and Asian supermarkets offer less common ones such as nut, oat, quinoa and hemp milks. These products can be found both on the shelf and in the refrigerated sections."
29,What difference will one person giving up meat make?,"A huge difference. The average British meat eater consumes, in the course of their lifetime, 5 cattle, 20 pigs, 29 sheep and lambs, 780 chickens, 46 turkeys, 18 ducks, 7 rabbits, 1, geese and half-a-tonne of fish. That is a lot of lives saved. Just as importantly, the best advertisement for veganism is a healthy and happy vegan: if you turn vegan you will be able to influence others to become part of the movement towards a more compassionate and rational world."
30,What is a vegan?,"Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. "
31,Is veganism good for your health?,"While no diet can guarantee a long and healthy life, becoming vegan may improve your odds. That’s largely because a vegan diet eliminates a number of unhealthful foods, including red and cured meats—two foods strongly linked to colon cancer. Vegans also tend to eat far more vegetables and fruits than non-vegetarians. Studies consistently show that people who eat the most fruits and vegetables tend to enjoy better health."
32,Why go vegan?,"A vegan lifestyle prevents a tremendous amount of animal slaughter and suffering. It offers a potent way to shrink our environmental footprint, especially in regard to climate change. And a well-planned vegan diet can fuel the highest levels of fitness, while reducing our risk of various chronic diseases. Plus, the food is insanely delicious and it becomes more widely available every year."
33,Why not just avoid factory farmed foods?,"Unless specifically labeled to the contrary, you can assume that every animal product came from a factory farm. As we’ve seen, every sort of cruelty is rampant at these places. A number of omnivores have pushed back against factory farm cruelties by demanding higher animal welfare standards. Most natural foods stores and supermarkets sell specially-labeled animal products from farms that promise better animal welfare. Additionally, many small-scale meat and egg producers rent stalls at local farmers’ markets. At their best, alternative farms deliver genuine improvements over factory farms. That’s mainly because they refuse to partake in the cruelest farming practices, particularly with regard to confinement and crowding. And with this reduced crowding, mutilations like beak searing and tail-clipping can be eliminated. That’s because animals unstressed by crowding are far less likely to attack or bully one another."
34,Will I need to supplement calcium if I don’t eat dairy?,"Not necessarily, you can get an adequate amount of calcium from a vegan diet. Good sources of calcium include green leafy vegetables, baked beans, black beans, dried figs, tahini and almonds. As well as this most plant milks are fortified with calcium too. In Australia the recommended calcium intake for adults ranges from 1000 to 1300 mg of calcium per day."
35,When was veganism created?,The term “vegan” was coined by the British animal rights activist Donald Watson in the 1940s. “Vegan” describes the philosophy that animals should not be exploited and hurt for food or other purposes.
36,Can you be an athlete on a vegan diet?,"From ultramarathoner Rich Roll and Olympian Carl Lewis to US Open winner Serena Williams, vegans prove time and again that you don’t need to support animal torture to be a star athlete."
37,Don't cows like being milked though?,"Though it may seem obvious, many people have no idea that in order to produce milk, cows have to be pregnant or have just given birth. Like all other mammals, cows lactate for their babies."
38,Isn't fixing human suffering and caring for human life more important?,Who says we can’t be vegan AND work to end human suffering? By choosing a humane vegan diet you are helping people as well as animals! 
39,How do vegans make cake?,"Many vegans like to use egg replacers, which are easy to make at home. Typical substitutes can include things like banana, flaxseed, applesauce and chia seeds."
40,Are vegans against pets? Would a vegan have pets?,"Pets are a blurry area for veganism, the reason for being how they're acquired. Pet shop practices that bring pets into existence are harmful to animals. If you can rescue an animal and have all the correct facilities and ability to keep them happy and healthy - then there is no issue."
41,Are vegans against wool? What do vegans think of wool?,"Most vegans are against wool, this is because wool is obtained by raising sheep with the sole purpose of shearing their wollen fleece. "
42,Who is the oldest vegan?,"The woman Loreen Dinwiddie lived to the age of 109, including 88 years she stuck to a strict vegan diet."
43,Do vegans live longer?,"On average, vegans and vegetarians live longer – they have longer life expectancies than meat-eaters, and grow old with fewer health issues. ... But, on average, vegans and vegetarians do live longer – they have lower mortality rates than meat-eaters, and grow old with fewer health issues (1)."
44,What would happen if everyone was vegan?,"According to a new study, a nation of 320 million vegans would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture by some 28%, far less than the amount now produced by the livestock industry."
45,"Animals Would Eat Us if They Could, and They Eat Each Other","Animals do all sorts of things to each other (and to us), including eating each other. Does this make it okay for us to do the same thing? There are three main issues with this.

The first is that not all animals eat each other - cows, for instance, are herbivores, so it seems a little unfair for us to eat them on the basis of other animals eating each other.
The second, much bigger issue is that animal behavior doesn't excuse our own behavior, because animals aren't able to understand or act according to morality. Like infants, they aren't responsible for what they do. The fact that an infant poops and vomits all over me doesn't show that it's okay for me to poop and vomit all over you. Unlike the infant, I have the ability to make moral choices."
46,Why should animals have rights?,"Why should children have rights?Why should the mentally handicapped have rights?Why should dogs have rights? (BTW, our pets have LOTS of rights)

Why should people from other countries have rights?

Why should anyone other than yourself have rights?

The answer to those questions is all the same: Because it's the right thing to do, because we want the right to our own body and life, and we have the capacity to understand that other beings, whether they can voice this desire or not, should be entitled to the same right."
47,Would you kill animals to control an invaisive species?,"A species is considered invasive due to either rapid reproduction or rapid destruction of another species. A species which does not rapidly reproduce and/or cause a rapid decline in another species is not invasive, it is a threat. By definition, an invasive species must be dealt with using death. There a number of ways to control species threats such as displacement, isolation, deterrence or other methods, however, invasive-species are are ones which adversely affect the environment.

Invasive animal species are quite often characterized as fast breeding, rapid growth, ability to live off a wide range of food types, strong tolerance to environmental changes and phenotypic plasticity.

What this means is a successful invasive species can eat anything, reproduces and grows fast, spreads quickly, is robust to environmental change and is able to rapidly change its immediate evolution (phenotype) to suit the demands of the new region. It becomes apparent quite quickly that there are two problems, invasive species compete for food and territory and food, as well as over-exhausting prey populations & they, outbreed native species.

There is only one solution to combat invasive species, you must ensure they don't breed. You could try to relocate them, but due to their rapid reproduction and growth and alarming dispersal, if they're not placed in a suitable ecosystem, they will become invasive in that one too. To ensure invasive species don't breed, you can either neuter them or you can kill them.

To break that down - neutering is a resource intensive solution and as identified, invasive species rapidly reproduce and mature. By the time a species is declared invasive, that is already a substantial population to capture, neuter and then release, to then cause destruction and death to the rest of the environment. The other problem with the solution of neutering is that if you see a feral animal, there is no effective way to tell if it is neutered or not.

The alternative is to simply declare those feral animals in certain areas to be killed. This is highly cost-effective and resource efficient, so much so that there is an actual industry for profitable varmit control - there is not a profitable industry for environmental conservation."
48,Would you eat roadkill?,"Roadkill is a great source of meat for obligate carnivores. If humans want to eat it, feel free, but since it is by no means necessary, I can't for the life of me understand why someone would."
49,Can zoos be ethical?,"There are three main ethical problems with zoos:

They normalize the idea that animals are only good for human pleasure and entertainment.

The animals on display are often kept in cramped, unnatural environments that take a toll on their mental health and general well being.

Keeping predators means keeping a supply chain of cheap meat to feed them. Zoos make little to no effort to ethically source their animal feed.

It's possible in principle to overcome these obstacles. It requires putting the animals' interests strictly higher than the human zoo patrons'. In practice, I think this would look more like an animal sanctuary than a zoo."
50,Where do vegans get Iron from?,"Iron is also a mineral, so it also comes from the ground like calcium. Most people can accept the mineral issue once you point it out to them but still have a hard time imagining that you can obtain enough iron through plants alone."
51,What About Omega 3 Fatty Acids?,"flax and chia are chock full of omega 3 fats, as are walnuts and hemp seeds"
52,is soy or soya bad for us?,"Evidence suggests that soya is not a threat to our health and is in fact a reliable and healthy protein source. Vegans aren't required to eat soya and it's possible to enjoy a healthy, well-balanced diet without it."
53,Can my dog/cat go vegan?,"Generally speaking most dogs and cats can follow a vegan diet. There are several good brands of vegan animal food available across the world, and these can be ordered online or found in some vegan stores. Dogs and particularly cats need an amino acid called taurine, which must be present in their food as it is essential for their wellbeing. This amino acid is found in animal products: however, it is also synthetically created on a commercial scale and is added to good quality vegan animal foods"
54,How many vegans are there in the UK?,"We found the number of vegans in Great Britain has quadrupled from 2014 to 2019. The numbers rose from 0.25% (150,000) of the population in 2014 to 0.46% (276,000) in 2016 to 1.16% in 2019 (600,000)."
55,If an animal is dead already can we eat them?,"We can go onto say that the animals are bred purely for you to eat them, so stop eating them and they will stop being bred for slaughter. Last year 400 million less animals were bred to be killed due to people decreasing their meat intake."
56,Which country is best for vegans?," The UK was the most popular country for veganism in 2019, according to Google Trends, followed by the Australia and New Zealand."
57,How many chickens are killed each year?,"Globally, more than 66 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of food, for both their meat and eggs."
58,Is Wet n Wild Cruelty-Free?,"The company wet n wild has expanded sales of its products to China but remains cruelty-free. Its products have not been tested on animals there, and it has worked with PETA to take the additional steps required to ensure that no tests on animals will be conducted for its products in the future.
In 2014, two years after PETA revealed that some cosmetics companies were paying the Chinese government to conduct tests on animals in order to market them there, the government announced a regulatory change that enables companies that manufacture non-special use cosmetics in China to sell them without tests on animals. Non-special use cosmetics include products such as foundation, eyeshadow, lipstick, mascara, and perfumes that don’t make a “functional” claim. These products must be manufactured in China in order to qualify for the exemption.
In order to be eligible for inclusion on PETA’s Beauty Without Bunnies cruelty-free list, companies that sell in China may only sell domestically manufactured (made in China) non-special use cosmetics. They must commit to not introducing any products that would require tests on animals; commit to withdrawing their products from the region rather than allowing any tests on animals, should they become required; and inform Chinese authorities of this policy to ensure that they are notified and can withdraw from the market in the unlikely event that tests on animals become required for their products.
We’re happy to report that wet n wild has met all the requirements of our Beauty Without Bunnies program and remains cruelty-free while selling products in China.
"
59,What is speciesism?,"“Speciesism” is the human-held belief that all other animal species are inferior. Speciesist thinking involves considering animals—who have their own desires, needs, and complex lives—as means to human ends. This supremacist line of “reasoning” is used to defend treating other living, feeling beings as property, objects, or even ingredients. It’s a bias rooted in denying others their own agency, interests, and self-worth, often for personal gain.
This toxic worldview also leads humans to draw non-existent distinctions between animal species, based solely on the purpose that those animals might serve. For example, most humans wouldn’t dream of treating their dog the way pigs are treated in the food industry, even though pigs are able to experience the same pain, joy, fear, and misery that canines do. Many humans wear coats lined with fur trim taken from trapped coyotes or sleep on a pillow stuffed with feathers pulled from a screaming goose, but they’d never consider ripping fistfuls of fur out of a crying kitten’s back with their own hands. It’s speciesist to believe that farmed and captive animals don’t suffer or feel emotions to the same extent as the animals with whom we lovingly share our homes.
PETA’s mission statement says, “Animals are not ours to experiment on, eat, wear, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way.” This means that animals are individuals—their own people—and have the right to live free from human exploitation. Speciesism is the ugly counterpoint to this truth. Although it goes unnoticed by most people, speciesism has devastating real-world effects on billions of animals. That’s why PETA—and compassionate people everywhere—work hard to fight it.

"
60,Is it OK to eat eggs from chickens I’ve raised in my backyard?,"As an animal rights group, we cannot condone using animals for any reason, which is why PETA promotes a healthy vegan lifestyle. However, we would not oppose eating eggs from chickens treated as companions if the birds receive excellent care and are not purchased from hatcheries. Make sure you’re ready for the commitment of adopting chickens, as they will continue to be a part of your family long after they stop producing eggs.
Hatcheries breed chickens to have “desirable” traits despite any negative effects this inbreeding may have on their health. It’s also common for sickly chicks to be tossed out and left to die, while male chicks, who don’t produce eggs and are seen as disposable, are often ground up while still alive. Doing business with hatcheries encourages them to continue to breed and hurt chickens. The only ethical way to obtain chickens is to adopt them from animal shelters or rescue groups that have the birds’ best interests at heart.
You should also know that chickens require specialized veterinary care—something that many veterinarians, who are used to working with dogs and cats, will not be able to provide.
Many people choose not to eat eggs for health reasons. All eggs, regardless of their origin, are high in fat and cholesterol and don’t contain any fiber. In many studies, researchers have found that higher levels of cholesterol are linked to a greater risk of having a heart attack. For every 1 percent increase in the amount of cholesterol in your blood, there is a 2 percent increase in your risk of having a heart attack. Conversely, every 1 percent reduction in your cholesterol level reduces your risk by 2 percent. Elevated cholesterol—anything above 150—promotes atherosclerosis, the buildup of cholesterol, fat, and cells in the arteries that feed the heart. When these arteries become clogged, a section of this muscle loses its blood supply. The result is a heart attack.
The best thing that anyone can do to help animals is to choose not to eat them, and we have so many choices as consumers that there’s simply no reason to use animals to feed ourselves. By making this choice, you’ll be helping animals and yourself as well: A vegan diet helps prevent strokes, osteoporosis, kidney stones, many types of cancer, diabetes, hypoglycemia, kidney disease, peptic ulcers, hernias, obesity, gallstones, hypertension, asthma, and many other medical conditions and diseases.

61,What is veganism's stance on faux fur?,"Our goal is to reduce the sum total of animal suffering. For people who want the look of real fur, faux fur can be a good alternative. It’s important to note, though, that news reports have indicated that major retailers have been found selling real fur that was mislabeled as faux. Of course, if you ever have any doubts about whether an item contains real or faux fur, the best choice is to avoid it altogether.
We understand and respect that many people choose not to purchase any faux-fur or faux-leather products, as they don’t want to promote the fashion. For those who do wear fakes, PETA has pins and stickers to help people make it clear that their jackets and other items weren’t made from animals.

62,Is tattoo ink vegan?,"A tattoo can be a creative, eye-catching way to display your passion for animal rights. However, some tattoo inks are actually made with animal products. Nonvegan varieties may contain bone char, glycerin from animal fat, gelatin from hooves, or shellac from beetles. So as you’re checking out tattoo shops, ask if they use vegan inks or if they can order some for you. Some great vegan brands include Eternal, StarBrite, SkinCandy, and Stable Color. You may also want to take along your own razor, since the ones they have in-house may have a gel strip made from glycerin. And of course, you’ll want your tattoo-care products to be vegan as well. Try The Merry Hempsters Vegan Hemp Tattoo Balm, Black Cat Vitamin Infusion Serum, Ohana Organics Tattoo Butter, or even jojoba oil, olive oil, or shea butter. No matter what artwork you choose, your vegan tattoo will be an animal rights conversation piece!

63,What is gelatin made of?,"Gelatin is a protein obtained by boiling skin, tendons, ligaments, and/or bones with water. It is usually obtained from cows or pigs. Gelatin is used in shampoos, face masks, and other cosmetics; as a thickener for fruit gelatins and puddings (such as Jell-O); in candies, marshmallows, cakes, ice cream, and yogurts; on photographic film; and in vitamins as a coating and as capsules, and it is sometimes used to assist in “clearing” wines. Gelatin is not vegan. However, there is a product called “agar agar” that is sometimes marketed as “gelatin,” but it is vegan. It is derived from a type of seaweed.

Kosher symbols and markings are not reliable indicators on which vegans or vegetarians should base their purchasing decisions. This issue is complex, but the “K” or “Kosher” symbols basically mean that the food-manufacturing process was overseen by a rabbi, who theoretically ensures that it meets Hebrew dietary laws. The food also may not contain both dairy products and meat, but it may contain one or the other. “P” or “Parve” means that the product contains no meat or dairy products, but it may contain fish or eggs. Kosher gelatin is usually made from a fish source. “D,” as in “Kosher D,” means that the product either contains milk or was made with dairy machinery. For example, a chocolate and peanut candy may be marked “Kosher D” even if it doesn’t contain milk because the nondairy chocolate was manufactured on machinery that also made milk chocolate.

64,How do aquariums treat marine mammals?,"Marine mammals—highly intelligent, sensitive, social beings—suffer greatly in captivity. The chlorine and copper sulfate used to keep tanks clean has caused dolphins’ skin to peel off and may cause them to go blind. Many marine mammals suffer from peptic ulcers, often resulting in death, because of frustration from their unnatural lives in captivity. Captivity also tears families apart. In the wild, orcas often spend their entire lives with their mothers and siblings. Wild dolphins swim together in family pods of three to 10 individuals or in tribes of hundreds.
While the aquarium industry claims that it exists purely for education and conservation, what aquariums really teach is that it is acceptable to keep animals in captivity, bored, cramped, lonely, far from their natural homes, and at the mercy of people. Marine mammal conservation is achieved through the abolition of whaling, the cleanup of our oceans, the end of driftnet fishing, and a prohibition on live captures—not through forcing whales and dolphins to swim in endless circles for our entertainment.
Captive displays stand in contrast to the truly educational experiences that many facilities offer, such as the opportunity to see marine mammals swim freely in their ocean home via whale- and dolphin-watching boat trips. Aquariums could also broadcast real-time videos of marine mammal rehabilitation efforts into their theaters, on the Internet, and into classrooms. There are countless ways to educate the public and cultivate respect for animals without imprisoning dolphins and whales—it’s time to put the focus on teaching visitors how to protect marine life rather than harm it. For more information, see PETA’s factsheet on Marine Mammal Parks.

65,L’Oréal is included on veganism's “do test” list. What does that mean?,
66,Are animal ingredients included in white sugar?,"Bone char, which is used to process sugar, is made from the bones of cattle from Afghanistan, Argentina, India, and Pakistan. The bones are sold to traders in Scotland, Egypt, and Brazil who then sell them back to the U.S. sugar industry. The European Union and the USDA heavily regulate the use of bone char. Only countries that are deemed BSE-free can sell the bones of their cattle for this process. Bone char—often referred to as natural carbon—is widely used by the sugar industry as a decolorizing filter, which allows the sugar cane to achieve its desirable white color. Other types of filters involve granular carbon or an ion-exchange system rather than bone char.
Bone char is also used in other types of sugar. Brown sugar is created by adding molasses to refined sugar, so companies that use bone char in the production of their regular sugar also use it in the production of their brown sugar. Confectioner’s sugar—refined sugar mixed with cornstarch—made by these companies also involves the use of bone char. Fructose may, but does not typically, involve a bone-char filter. Supermarket brands of sugar (e.g., Giant, Townhouse, etc.) obtain their sugar from several different refineries, making it impossible to know whether it has been filtered with bone char.
If you want to avoid all refined sugars, we recommend alternatives such as Sucanat and turbinado sugar, which are not filtered with bone char. Additionally, beet sugar—though normally refined—never involves the use of bone char and Edward & Sons Trading Company has developed a vegan confectioner’s sugar which should be available in health food stores soon.
It would be virtually impossible for PETA to maintain information on the refining process used for the sugar in every product. We encourage you to contact companies directly to ask about the source of their sugar.

67,Couldn’t we just build more animal shelters rather than euthanize dogs and cats?,"
A shelter should be a temporary compromise for dogs and cats. It is not a solution to companion animal homelessness. Dogs and cats need more than food, water, and shelter from the elements. They need and deserve loving care, regular human companionship, respect for their individuality, and the opportunity to play and run. As difficult as it may be for us to accept, euthanasia (carried out by veterinarians or shelter staff trained in intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital) is often the most compassionate and dignified way for unwanted animals to leave this uncaring world.

69,What’s wrong with wearing wool?,"As with other industries where animals are raised for a profit, the interests of the animals used in the wool industry are rarely considered. Flocks usually consist of thousands of sheep, and individual attention to their needs is virtually impossible. Many people believe that shearing sheep helps animals who might otherwise be burdened with too much wool, but without human interference, sheep grow just enough wool to protect themselves from temperature extremes.

Australia produces about a quarter of all wool used worldwide. Within weeks of birth, lambs’ ears are hole-punched, their tails are chopped off, and the males are castrated without anesthetics. Shearers are usually paid by volume, not by the hour, which encourages fast work without regard for the welfare of the sheep. Says one eyewitness: “[T]he shearing shed must be one of the worst places in the world for cruelty to animals … I have seen shearers punch sheep with their shears or their fists until the sheep’s nose bled. I have seen sheep with half their faces shorn off …”
In Australia, the most commonly raised sheep are merinos, specifically bred to have wrinkly skin, which means more wool per animal. This unnatural overload of wool causes animals to die of heat exhaustion during hot months, and the wrinkles also collect urine and moisture. Attracted to the moisture, flies lay eggs in the folds of skin, and the hatched maggots can eat the sheep alive. To prevent this so-called “flystrike,” Australian ranchers perform a barbaric operation—mulesing—or carving huge strips of flesh off the backs of lambs’ legs and around their tails. This is done to cause smooth, scarred skin that won’t harbor fly eggs, yet the bloody wounds often get flystrike before they heal. Every year, hundreds of lambs die before the age of 8 weeks from exposure or starvation, and mature sheep die every year from disease, lack of shelter, and neglect. To learn more, visit PETA.org.
"
70,Is wine vegan?,"The majority of people are unaware that wine, although made from grapes, may have been made using animal-derived products. During the winemaking process, the liquid is filtered through substances called “fining agents.” This process is used to remove protein, yeast, cloudiness, “off” flavors and colorings, and other organic particles. Popular animal-derived fining agents used in the production of wine include blood and bone marrow, casein (milk protein), chitin (fiber from crustacean shells), egg albumen (derived from egg whites), fish oil, gelatin (protein from boiling animal parts), and isinglass (gelatin from fish bladder membranes).
Thankfully, there are several common fining agents that are animal-friendly and used to make vegan wine. Carbon, bentonite clay, limestone, kaolin clay, plant casein, silica gel, and vegetable plaques are all suitable alternatives. You can check your local organic or health food stores, local organic winemakers, and co-op’s, and most regular wine/liquor stores will order vegan wines upon request.
An extensive list of vegan wines is available at Barnivore.com.
The following are examples of a few companies that sell vegan wine online:
BevVeg! is a vegan certification company that specializes in certifying beverages. Its website has a beverage search feature, like that of Barnivore.
"
71,Why shouldn’t cats be allowed outdoors?,"Cats should be allowed outdoors for walks on leashes, just as dogs are, and to explore securely fenced yards. A product called “Cat Fence-In,” a flexible mesh barrier that is placed at the top of a privacy fence, prevents cats from climbing out.
Like dogs or small children, cats let outdoors without supervision are vulnerable to cars, other animals, cruel people, and disease. Feline leukemia, feline AIDS (FIV), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), toxoplasmosis, distemper, heartworm, and rabies can be difficult to detect and, in the case of FIP and distemper, impossible to test for. Most of these ailments are highly contagious to other companion animals.
Many people consider free-roaming cats pests. They do not want the cats to urinate, defecate, dig, eat plants, or kill birds on their properties. Free-roaming cats have been shot, poisoned, and stolen by angry neighbors.
Fortunately, cats can live happy lives indoors. 
"
72,Which candies are vegan?,"It’s no secret that vegans love to eat, and we like our sweets just as much as the next person. Fortunately, loads of candies are vegan, so we can indulge our cravings (mostly) guilt-free. Most dark chocolate is vegan, as are popular sweet treats such as Smarties (known as Rockets in Canada), Oreos, Airheads, Jujubes, and Swedish Fish (some Swedish Fish contain beeswax, so be sure to check the label). Check out PETA’s database of accidentally vegan foods for a full list, including candy, cookies, and ice cream.
While we update the list frequently, companies do change their ingredients from time to time. The main ingredients to watch out for in candy are carmine, which is a red pigment made from the crushed female cochineal insect; gelatin, obtained by boiling the skin, tendons, ligaments, and bones of cows and pigs; and shellac (also called confectioner’s glaze), which gives candies a glossy coating and is made from the resinous excretions of certain insects. Some sugar may also be refined with bone char—see PETA’s position on bone char here.
The most important thing to keep in mind is that being vegan isn’t about personal purity―it’s about reducing animal suffering. If we avoid products that are 99.9 percent vegan but contain trace amounts of animal products, we send the message to companies that there is no market for more animal-friendly goods, and we’ve hurt more animals than we’ve helped. It also makes being vegan seem difficult and time-consuming to people around us. PETA encourages people to do their best to maintain a vegan lifestyle but not to spend time worrying about trace amounts of ingredients that may be animal-derived.

"
74,What is the best way to get rid of fleas and ticks?,"
Although PETA encourages nonlethal methods of insect control whenever possible, we realize that lethal methods sometimes must be used to combat insects, just as lethal means must sometimes be used to defend ourselves against animals and humans who attack us. In the case of a flea or tick problem, while it is necessary to eliminate the insects in order to protect your companion animal from resulting problems such as flea dermatitis or tick-borne diseases once there is an infestation, the best approach is prevention.
To that end, the best long-term preventive is an insect growth regulator called Precor. This flea hormone will cause sterility in the offspring of any flea that touches it, so spray it every four months on your carpets, hardwood floors, and upholstery (but never on your animals!).
The next line of defense is a healthy coat. Fleas prefer flaking, raw, itchy skin because their role in nature is to “take out” the unhealthy animals. To produce a flea-resistant coat in your dog or cat, add flaxseed oil and calcium ascorbate powder (buffered vitamin C) to the animal’s food. B-complex vitamins are also extremely helpful to the condition of the skin. Garlic is a natural flea repellant when added to your animal’s food, and black walnut capsules given as a supplement repel fleas as well. Additionally, a diet rich in fresh, whole foods and low in processed foods and additives will also contribute to the health of your animal’s coat.
Effective flea control programs employ a multifaceted approach. Flea-combing every day is very effective and helps you to keep tabs on the flea population. It also offers immediate relief from itching. Vacuum rugs and furniture daily, if necessary, during flea season. Flea eggs can be picked up by vacuuming but can still hatch in the bag, which should be sealed and thrown away or put in the freezer after each cleaning. For a flea infestation, sprinkle carpets with diatomaceous earth (a powder composed of the fossilized remains of one-celled algae), leave it down overnight, then vacuum it up. This will kill most fleas.
Avoid chemical powders, sprays, or flea collars. These toxic products can be very dangerous—many animals and people have been poisoned or killed by them. Never overdose an animal with a product, mix products (collar, dip, powder), or use a flea control product intended for a dog on a cat, a very small dog, or any other animal.
"
75,What are the dangers of using choke and prong collars?,"Choke and prong collars are designed to punish dogs for pulling by inflicting pain and discomfort. They can cause serious physical and emotional damage to dogs and should never be used.
The use of choke collars has been associated with whiplash, fainting, spinal cord injuries leading to paralysis, crushing of the trachea with partial or complete asphyxiation, crushing and/or fracture of the bones in the larynx, dislocated neck bones, bruising of the esophagus, bruising and damage to the skin and tissues in the neck, brain damage and prolapsed eyes caused by sharp increases in pressure in the head, and other injuries.
The metal spikes of prong collars pinch the skin around dogs’ necks when they pull and can scratch or puncture them. Over time, this can cause dogs to develop scar tissue (which has no feeling) and/or build up a tolerance to the painful pinching sensation and thus continue to pull, making walks even more difficult. Dogs may interpret the tightening of a choke or prong collar around their neck as a stranglehold (which it is, after all!) and become fearful or even aggressive.
The most humane and safest option for walking a dog who tends to want to pull is a front-leash attachment harness, such as the Sense-ation. When dogs lunge or pull while wearing the Sense-ation harness, the front leash attachment redirects them back toward the dogwalker. With patience and positive reinforcement, walks can be a pleasant experience for both human and dog.
"
76,How Do vegans Feel About Horseback Riding?,"In a perfect world, horses would be free to pursue their own lives and humans wouldn’t make demands of them. They’re herd animals who in nature, associate with other members of their large groups, graze in meadows, travel great distances, play, and engage in courtship behavior. They have needs, wants, and interests that are entirely independent from what humans ask and expect from them.
If we look honestly at our relationship with horses, we must acknowledge that the decision to take part in horseback riding is made solely by one individual with little benefit to and no input from the other.
Ren Hurst, author of Riding on the Power of Others: A Horsewoman’s Path to Unconditional Love, calls for an end to horseback riding, saying, “[W]e have this fundamental responsibility to not take advantage” of animals who have no control over whether or not they live with humans. It’s a new concept that’s evolving as our mindsets do, but the fundamental premise is a simple one: We can and must challenge our old patterns of thinking if we want to treat animals ethically—not as subservient to us but as our equals.
Horses deserve to live their lives as nature intended. We can connect with horses in our care and have a meaningful and mutually beneficial relationship with these sensitive animals without climbing on top of them.
"
77,What’s wrong with chaining dogs?,"
Condemning dogs to “solitary confinement” on a chain is so cruel that it is illegal in some cities. Chained dogs are exposed to searing heat, bitter cold, rain, and wind, putting them at risk for heat exhaustion, frostbite, and exposure. Chains can wrap around trees or other objects, water bowls can easily tip over, and food can quickly spoil in summer or freeze in winter.
Chained dogs often become overly fearful of intruders and protective of their tiny patch of ground. They are easy targets for cruel people who taunt and tease, putting their defenses on red alert. Not surprisingly, dogs who spend much of their lives tied out on a chain often become dangerous, while dogs who are well socialized and supervised rarely bite.
Perhaps worst of all, chained dogs are terribly lonely. They are pack animals who long to live with, love, and be loved by their human families. Denying a dog this companionship is so cruel that some dogs go crazy with loneliness. It’s best for everyone when dogs are treated as treasured family members.
"
78,What should I do if I can no longer keep my companion animal?,"
Having to give away a companion animal can be very traumatic for you and certainly for your animal. If circumstances make it impossible for you to keep or properly care for your animal and if you have exhausted resources such as trusted friends and relatives, don’t rush into a placement just because you are pressured for time. If you are unable to find an excellent home for your animal, take him or her to an animal shelter operated by a humane organization. Don’t avoid a shelter just because it performs euthanasia. A peaceful end is certainly preferable to being “warehoused” for years in a cage or a cruel, slow death by disease, exposure, starvation, or being crushed under the wheels of a car.
If your animal friend is old, very shy, or very dependent on you and you cannot find a home with someone he or she trusts and loves, the kindest course may lie in taking him or her to a veterinarian or shelter to be euthanized. Animals who have been with you a long time may suffer and pine terribly when you are gone. As a final kindness, remain in the room to comfort your old friend during euthanasia.
Never sell your animal or give him or her to anyone without checking for identification, the person’s full name, driver’s license number, address, and telephone number, and explain that you will visit his or her home (to ensure that he or she actually lives there). Ask for (and check) references from veterinarians, neighbors, and employers.
"
79,What’s wrong with eating honey?,"Unfortunately, like factory farmers, many beekeepers take inhumane steps to ensure personal safety and reach production quotas. It’s not unusual for larger honey producers to cut off the queen bee’s wings so that she can’t leave the colony or to have her artificially inseminated on a bee-sized version of the factory farm “rape rack.” When the keeper wants to move a queen to a new colony, she is carried with “bodyguard” bees, all of whom—if they survive transport—will be killed by bees in the new colony. Bees may be killed or have their wings and legs torn off by haphazard handling. According to the Cook-DuPage Beekeepers Association, humans have been using honey since about 15,000 B.C., but it wasn’t until the 20th century that people turned bees into factory-farmed animals. Happily, many sweeteners are made without killing bees: Rice syrup, molasses, sorghum, Sucanat, barley malt, maple syrup, organic cane sugar, and dried fruit or fruit concentrates can replace honey in recipes. Using these will keep your diet bee-free.
"
80,How do I know that companies on the cruelty-free list really don’t test on animals?,"
To a degree, PETA’s “statement of assurance” is a matter of trust. However, the integrity of a company is on the line. A company that has publicly announced an end to its animal testing and has stated in writing that it does not test on animals would face a public relations disaster—and potential lawsuits—if its policies were being misrepresented. Business owners are well aware that consumers are serious about the issue of animal testing, and they know that they would ruin the public’s confidence in their products if it were discovered that they were being dishonest about their policies.
"
81,How does eating meat harm the environment?,"When land is used to raise animals instead of crops, precious water and soil are lost, trees are cut down to make land for grazing or factory-farm sheds, and untreated animal waste pollutes rivers and streams. In fact, it has such a devastating effect on all aspects of our environment that the Union of Concerned Scientists lists meat-eating as one of the biggest environmental hazards facing the Earth. Globally, animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gases than all the world’s transportation systems combined. No wonder, when you consider facts like these:

82,"What is veganism's stance on programs that advocate trapping, spaying and neutering, and releasing feral cats?","Sadly, our experience with trap, spay-and-neuter, and release programs and “managed” feral cat colonies has led us to question whether or not these programs are truly in the cats’ best interests. We receive countless reports of incidents in which cats—“managed” or not—suffer and die horrible deaths because they must fend for themselves outdoors. Having witnessed firsthand the gruesome things that can happen to feral cats, we cannot in good conscience advocate trapping and releasing as a humane way to deal with overpopulation.
Advocates argue that feral cats are just as deserving as other felines and that it is our responsibility to alleviate their suffering and assure their safety. We absolutely agree. It is precisely because we would never encourage anyone to let their own cats outdoors to roam that we do not encourage the same for feral cats. In fact, the act of releasing a feral cat is, in the eyes of the law, abandonment and is illegal in many areas.
We believe that although altering feral cats prevents the suffering of future generations, it does little to improve the quality of life for the cats who are left outdoors and that allowing feral cats to continue their daily struggle for survival in a hostile environment is not usually a humane option.
Nevertheless, PETA’s position has never been that all feral cats should be euthanized. We believe that trap, vaccinate, spay/neuter, and release programs are acceptable when the cats are isolated from roads, people, and other animals who could harm them; regularly attended to by people who not only feed them but care for their medical needs; and situated in an area where they do not have access to wildlife and where the weather is temperate.

83,"My doctor wants me to take Premarin, but I understand it’s made from horse urine. Is this true?","The estrogen-replacement drug Premarin, prescribed to menopausal women, is made from horse urine; in fact, the drug’s name is short for PREgnant MARes’ urINe. About 750,000 mares are impregnated each year for the sole purpose of collecting their estrogen-rich urine. Tied in small stalls, unable to move either backwards, forwards, or sideways or lie down comfortably, they stand with sacks strapped to their groins for months on end. In order to make the urine more concentrated, their water intake is restricted, so the horses are constantly thirsty. The foals are considered “byproducts,” and most are fattened up, slaughtered, and sold for horsemeat or turned into dog food.
Fortunately, humane alternatives to Premarin are available. Cenestin, manufactured by Duramed Pharmaceuticals, is used to treat menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats. Duramed is currently conducting clinical trials to prove Cenestin’s effectiveness at preventing osteoporosis, as well. Like Premarin, Cenestin contains a complex mixture of conjugated estrogens that are slowly released into the body. But unlike Premarin, Cenestin is derived from plant sources—soybeans and yams—not horse urine. Recent studies linking Premarin to an increased risk of breast cancer serve as an additional reason to consider the switch.
Be aware that there is evidence that mammography screening is less accurate in women who use hormone replacement therapy. The same activities important for health at other times in our lives can help alleviate many of the common symptoms of menopause. Switching to a low-fat vegetarian diet, exercising, quitting smoking, and reducing stress could eliminate some women’s need for drugs in the first place.
"
84,Do vegans advocate spaying and neutering of companion animals?,"Yes, vigorously! Each year, 6-8 million precious animals will enter the front doors of animal shelters—and 3-4 million of them will go out the back doors in body bags. All of this misery and death could be prevented through spaying and neutering (surgical sterilization). Every stray cat and every neglected dog came from an animal who wasn’t spayed or neutered.
By preventing animals from being born, we prevent animals from being hit by cars, infected with lingering, painful diseases, attacked by other animals or cruel people, stolen by laboratory dealers, used as bait by dogfighters, or simply stuck outside to die of starvation, exposure, or neglect.
Spaying and neutering will help stop this cycle of abuse. PETA works very hard on this, educating the public about the need to spay and neuter through pamphlets, billboards, letters to the editor, ads, public service announcements, articles, and humane education in schools. We also provide spaying and neutering services for animal companions of low-income families and the elderly.
"
85,What are pocket pets?,"“Pocket pets” are exotic animals, such as prairie dogs, flying squirrels, spiny mice, and hedgehogs, whose popularity as fad pets has skyrocketed in recent years. Although their small size may make them look cute and cuddly, “pocket pets” are wild animals who have very special husbandry requirements. They suffer from the stress of being confined to small cages, are generally fed an improper diet, and are often forced to have an unnaturally high number of litters. Trauma and injuries result when these animals are handled improperly and dropped. “Pocket pets” frequently wind up in climates that they are not suited for and are tossed aside when a new fad arises. They can also be dangerous and carry the risk of disease.
If pet shops selling “pocket pets” are engaged in “de minimis” (small-scale) activities, they’re exempt from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s federal licensing requirements. The exemption includes exhibitors with eight or fewer “pet” animals, small exotic or wild mammals, and domesticated farm-type animals. This means that even the shoddiest animal dealers can operate without fear of violating the federal Animal Welfare Act.
"
86,What are Aquababies?,"
AquaBabies are 4-inch plastic cubes containing fish, snails, and frogs for sale in drugstores and convenience stores around the country. The AquaBabies containers do not provide adequate space for even the smallest of animals, and since they are frequently sold as “impulse” items next to cash registers, the majority of purchasers aren’t equipped with the knowledge they need to properly care for these animals. The fate of the surviving animals is bleak once they are purchased, and their presence on store shelves encourages an unenlightened attitude about animals. More and more companies are refusing to sell AquaBabies, including Walgreen’s, Eckerd, Rite Aid, and Albertson’s, because of customer complaints. Express your concern for animals whose lives are being endangered and lost in the hands of impulse buyers by writing to companies that sell AquaBabies.
"
87,What should I do if I find feral or stray animals?,"
If feral or stray animals turn up at your doorstep, don’t assume that they have homes and are just visiting. It never hurts to err on the side of caution and take them in. If they have families, your signs and ads will bring them running. If they don’t have homes, your intervention could save their lives.
Stray and feral animals can rarely survive long on their own. They die of disease, poisoning, starvation, theft by laboratory dealers, and worse. One beautiful white stray cat, nicknamed “Bob,” was fed by several families but not adopted by any of them. Someone finally called PETA after wounds that Bob had suffered in an attack by a dog went untreated for several months. By then, it was too late to save him.
If you spot a stray, bring him or her inside! If the animal is not sterilized, one stray can quickly turn into a dozen. If a stray flees when you approach, start putting out food to get him or her into the habit of visiting. Borrow a humane box trap from your local animal shelter or purchase one from Tomahawk Live Trapping Company (1-800-27-ATRAP).
Check for tags; many lost animals are reunited with their families because someone took the time to call. But don’t assume that because the animal has a collar, he or she has a home. Many are abandoned, or their families have given up looking for them.
Immediately file a “found” report at all area shelters (animals can wander many miles). Don’t be afraid to take the animal to a well-run shelter—that’s usually the first place where people look. Place a classified ad in the newspaper (many papers run “found” ads for free or at a discount). Put up signs within a 2-mile radius that say, “Found cat. Call [telephone number].” Don’t give any details. Let callers give you details; this weeds out people who are trying to acquire animals under false pretenses to sell to laboratories or dogfighting rings.
If no one claims the animal, find a home where he or she will live inside as a member of the family. Visit the home, ask lots of questions, ask for and check references, and have adopters sign a contract. (Order our “Finding the Right Home” brochure for more details.) Always sterilize animals before they go to their new homes. Call 1-800-248-SPAY for information on low-cost spay/neuter programs in your area. If you are unable to find a good home, take the animal to a reputable shelter run by a humane organization.
"
88,What’s wrong with keeping birds in cages?,"
All caged birds are either captured or captive-bred. In the wild, these beautiful beings are never alone, and if separated even for just a moment, they call wildly to their flockmates. Flock-oriented, they preen each other, fly together, play, and share egg-incubation duties. Many species of birds mate for life and share parenting tasks. Most birds will not take a second mate in the wild if their first is lost.
Life in captivity is often a death sentence for birds, who may suffer from malnutrition, an improper environment, loneliness, and the stress of confinement. Birds are meant to fly and be with others of their own kind in a natural environment. Confinement causes birds to have temper tantrums and mood swings. The New York Times has reported that many birds “go off the deep end when they are … placed in captivity. … The resulting frustration, [Cambridge University zoologist Dr. James Serpell] said, leads to abnormalities like repetitive behavior, in which the bird’s head weaves back and forth, or in which it shifts constantly from one foot to the other; abnormal grooming in which the bird picks out all of its feathers, and aggressive behavior.”
Birds are smuggled into the United States more than any other animal. Before being shipped, birds are often force-fed, their wings are clipped, their beaks are taped shut, and they are crammed into everything from spare tires to luggage. It’s not unusual for most of the birds in one shipment to die.
Taking animals from their natural habitats endangers individual animals and jeopardizes entire populations and ecosystems. The population of the South American hyacinth macaw has dropped significantly over the last 10 years as a result of smugglers’ capturing the birds for U.S. and European collectors.
Birds bred in captivity don’t fare much better. Birds older than 8 to 10 weeks of age don’t sell well at pet shops so many are kept for breeding and condemned to small cages for the rest of their lives.
If you love birds, contact a bird rescue group in your area to learn how you can foster or adopt an abused or neglected bird.
"
89,Do ingredients of synthetic or plant origin work as well as their animal-derived counterparts?,"
Remember, animal ingredients are used because they are generally cheaper, not because they are better than vegetable-derived or synthetic ingredients. Today’s slaughterhouses must dispose of the byproducts of the slaughter of billions of animals every year and have found an easy and profitable solution in selling them to food and cosmetics manufacturers.  Furthermore, rendering plants process the bodies of millions of tons of dead animals every year, transforming decaying flesh and bones into profitable animal ingredients. Slaughterhouses, which provide the inedible parts of animals killed for food, are the primary sources of rendered animals, but the bodies of dogs and cats who are euthanized in animal shelters wind up at rendering plants too.
"
90,Do you have any suggestions for keeping up with all the hair that my cat sheds?,
91,"I have an ant problem. I’d rather not kill the ants, but I do want to get rid of them. What should I do?","
Avoid using insect sprays. Pesticides are the number two cause of household poisonings in the U.S., as people and companion animals breathe in the toxic air. The best way to keep ants out of your house safely and naturally is by using products you may have in your kitchen cabinets right now. Try pouring a line of cream of tartar, red chili powder, paprika, or dried peppermint at the place where you think ants might be entering the house; they won’t cross it. You can also try washing countertops, cabinets, and floors with equal parts vinegar and water. To keep insects out in the first place, fill holes and cracks in walls with caulk or white glue. Finally, probably the most important thing you can do is to avoid giving insects a food supply, by keeping living areas clean. Be careful to sweep up crumbs, wash dishes immediately, store food in tightly sealed containers, and empty garbage frequently.
"
92,Is it safe to feed my dog or cat a vegetarian diet?,"“A growing body of evidence appears to indicate that dogs and cats can survive, and indeed thrive, on nutritionally-sound vegetarian and vegan diets,” according to Andrew Knight and Madelaine Leitsberger, the authors of a review in the journal Animals of four studies that examined the nutritional adequacy of vegetarian diets for cats and dogs. One study comparing the health of vegetarian cats to that of cats on conventional diets found no significant differences in perceived health status between the two groups.
Some dogs are even sensitive to meat and do better without it for that reason. Many commercial meat-based dog and cat foods contain ingredients that are harmful to them, such as pesticides, hormones, antibiotics, preservatives, poor-quality fillers, and parts of animals that are deemed unfit for human consumption, such as ground-up feathers and diseased flesh.
Dogs are considered omnivores, but many require taurine and L-carnitine, which are found in raw meat, in their diets. These amino acids can prevent dilated cardiomyopathy in breeds that are prone to the disease. Nowadays, however, most commercial dog foods, both vegetarian and meat-based, contain them, and if you want to feed a homemade diet, you can purchase them in powder form online or at a health food store.
Cats have nutritional requirements that are more stringent than those of dogs. Vitamin A, taurine, and arachidonic acid are essential for maintaining their health. Today, these are also found in any high-quality commercial cat food, and they also can be added to a homemade, plant-based diet.
Many people supplement the diets of both their dogs and their cats with fresh fruit, such as melon, bananas, and apples; vegetables, such as green beans and carrots; whole grains, such as millet and barley; homemade dog biscuits; and superfoods such as spirulina, nutritional yeast, and nori.
For a smooth transition, start by mixing vegetarian food (several brands are available to choose from, including v-dog, Amì, and Wild Earth, or follow the vegan recipes in Dr. Pitcairn’s Complete Guide to Natural Health for Dogs and Cats or that come with Vegepet supplements) with the meat-based food. Gradually increase the vegetarian portion and decrease the meat-based diet over one to two weeks. Most, but not all, dogs and cats can do well on a vegetarian diet, so watch closely to be sure that the new diet is agreeing with your animal companion. If you notice skin or digestive problems, you may need to make adjustments. Try a different brand or recipe, or if necessary, go back to feeding the previous diet.

93,How do I choose a veterinarian?,"
It’s essential to choose a veterinarian you can trust. Ask for references from trusted friends and humane organizations and call the local Better Business Bureau, the Chamber of Commerce, and your State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners to check for previous complaints from clients. To find a holistic veterinarian, call 410-569-0795.
Before making an appointment with a veterinarian you’ve never met, call or visit to chat briefly with him or her. Ask if emergency service is available and if the clinic offers payment plans, has surgical and x-ray capabilities, and has ’round the clock supervision of hospitalized animals. Once you’ve found a veterinarian you like, don’t hesitate to get second and third opinions from other veterinarians when treatment of any kind is recommended. Never allow your animal to be taken out of your sight for treatment.
"
94,Do you approve of electric fences and shock collars?,"Electronic fences and shock collars electrically shock dogs when they cross an invisible line, bark, or don’t respond to a command. These cruel devices physically hurt animals and can cause severe psychological problems as well. Companion animals should not have to live in fear of receiving electric shocks for normal behavior, such as barking. Positive training methods, in which dogs are rewarded for what they do right, are kinder and more effective.
Dogs trained with shock collars and electric fences may develop fears of or aggression aimed at what they BELIEVE is the source of the shock (kids riding by on bikes, the mailman, the dog next door, etc.). Dogs have been known to run through electric barriers when frightened by fireworks or chasing a squirrel, and then are scared to cross back through the barrier.
It’s also worth noting that while electric fences may keep your dog inside the yard, they do nothing to protect your companion from other roaming dogs, cruel humans, or other animals who can freely enter the property.
"
95,Are Nylabone chew toys safe?,"
A recent TV news investigation described how pieces of Nylabone’s “Plaque Attacker,” a synthetic bone manufactured by T.F.H. Publications, one of the largest companion animal product manufacturers, have broken off and become lodged in dogs’ intestinal tracts, causing massive infection and death. Because the “Plaque Attacker’s” chips do not show up on x-rays, the only chance of finding the cause of an infection is surgery or, tragically, in hundreds of dogs’ cases, necropsy.
Fortunately, after years of pressure by concerned individuals, Nylabone has recalled the “Plaque Attacker” and recently announced plans to introduce a new, safer product.
"
96,What should I do if an ingredient seems questionable but is not included on the list of animal ingredients and their alternatives?,"
The list is not exhaustive. There are thousands of technical and patented names for ingredient variations. In fact, some ingredients go by the same name whether they are of animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin. If you have a question regarding a product’s ingredients, call the manufacturer directly.
"
97,What’s so bad about eating eggs?,"Chickens don’t need to be killed for their eggs, right? While both male and female chickens can be raised for meat, only females can produce eggs, so about 346 million male chicks per year are disposed of by being shoved into plastic bags and left to suffocate. They cannot be raised profitably as “broilers” or “fryers” because they have not been engineered to produce a lot of muscle.
Conditions at egg factory farms are atrocious. Cage floors are of wire mesh so waste falls from the upper tiers onto the chickens below. A single cage, roughly 16 by 18 inches, holds five to six hens, each with a wingspan of 32 inches. Hens bred to be super layers experience so much stress that their accelerated laying span lasts only a year and a half—two years at most—compared with the 15 to 20 years that hens produce eggs under natural conditions. Hens today lay about twice as many eggs per year as hens laid several decades ago, before factory farming, and their tired bodies pay the price.

"
98,What is veganism's position on euthanasia?,"
Every day in the United States, tens of thousands of puppies and kittens are born. Compare this to the nearly 11,000 human births each day, and it’s clear that there can never be enough homes for all these animals. Shelters are stuck with the heartrending job of dealing with animals nobody wants. Those who refuse to spay and neuter their animals, who abandon animals when they grow tired of them, and who patronize pet shops instead of adopting stray or shelter animals make euthanasia a tragic necessity.
"
99,What industries am I supporting when I buy products that use animal ingredients?,"
Animal ingredients come from every industry that uses animals—the meat, fur, wool, dairy, egg, and fishing industries as well as industries such as horseracing and rodeo, which send unwanted animals to slaughter.
 
Visit PETA’s home page to learn more about the animals who suffer in these industries and what you can do to help.
"
100,Do vegans endorse the companies that are noted as cruelty-free?,"
Inclusion in the cruelty-free section does not imply endorsement of any company or product by PETA. We encourage consumers to shop responsibly and to question companies about their products and business practices before making any purchase. PETA reserves the right to choose which companies will be included, based on each company’s policies.
"
101,"What about products with labels that say, “No animal testing” but whose manufacturing company is not on veganism's “don’t test” list?","Labels can be deceptive, so be careful. No specific laws exist regarding cruelty-free labeling of products, so companies can take liberties. While it is unlikely that a company would put blatantly false information regarding its animal-testing practices on its products, statements on labels may be misleading and not fully informative. Many companies that do test on animals have some cruelty-free products, but we must boycott all the companies’ products in order to pressure them into putting an end to all animal tests.
If the label on a company’s product says that it is not tested on animals, and you cannot find the company on either of PETA’s lists, please share the company’s contact information with us so that we can formally inquire about the company’s animal-testing policy. Likewise, if you communicate with a company that claims to be cruelty-free, please ask for a statement in writing and copy the statement to PETA. We will determine whether the company meets our cruelty-free criteria. Meanwhile, PETA recommends that you purchase only products made by companies on our “don’t test” list.
"
102,Is it possible to buy cruelty-free contact lenses and solutions?,"Yes! PETA Business Friend Clear Conscience sells cruelty-free contact lens solution, redness-relieving eye drops, and lubricant eye drops. They may be purchased at ClearConscience.com.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which promulgates regulations regarding the safety testing of contact lens products, does not explicitly require that contact lens solutions be tested on animals. Despite this good news, our research indicates that manufacturers of contact lens products are staunchly resistant to eliminating animals from their testing procedures. Because these products are used in the eyes, they must undergo more extensive safety tests than other products, like cosmetics, which are primarily applied to the surface of the skin. Manufacturers use this reason and their fear of consumer lawsuits as excuses to continue testing on animals despite the questionable validity of animal tests and the existence of humane alternatives.
It’s time to put some pressure on the manufacturers of contact lens products. Please use your power as a consumer to write to them and ask that they eliminate animal testing for their products.

103,How do I find out if my prescription medication contains ingredients from animal sources?,"
"
104,How often is the information on veganism's cruelty-free company search page updated?,"PETA’s online lists of companies that do test and that don’t test on animals are updated frequently to reflect additions (e.g., if we are informed of a new company’s policy prohibiting animal testing), deletions (e.g., if a company that doesn’t test on animals is purchased by a company that tests on animals or if a company goes out of business), changes in contact information, etc.
PETA’s printed version of the Cruelty-Free Shopping Guide is updated approximately twice a year and is based on the most current information available at the time of printing. Companies’ animal-testing policies can change after any given edition is printed.
PETA reserves the right to choose which companies are included, based on companies’ policies. Inclusion on any list is not an endorsement by PETA of a company or any of its products.
"
105,How often are veganism's company lists updated?,"
"
106,I’ve discovered that a company in the cruelty-free section harms animals in other ways. Why is it still included on the list?,"
Because there are so many ways in which companies may be involved in harming animals, it’s virtually impossible to compile a list of companies that are 100 percent cruelty-free. For example, a company that doesn’t test on animals may make a corporate donation to the American Cancer Society, a charity that funds animal experiments; a manufacturer that doesn’t harm animals may start an advertising campaign that uses animals; or a company that opposes animal testing may do a publicity event with a circus. The possibilities are endless. PETA is opposed to all animal use, so this is a tough call for us.
It is impossible for us to keep track of all these things, and unfortunately, we could probably find an objection with almost every company. Therefore, we have decided to maintain the cruelty-free company section based solely upon a company’s animal-testing policies. However, we continue to fight for the rights of animals through our campaigns and activities and always encourage people to take a close look at the companies that they support.
"
107,Does film contain gelatin?,
108,Why is Melaleuca included on the “do test” list?,"We removed Melaleuca from our list of companies that do not test on animals after learning that it commissioned two animal tests that were not required by law.
In 1996, during the course of litigation with a competing company, Melaleuca commissioned a lethal-dose test on the competitor’s product. The test resulted in the agonizing deaths of 10 rats. In 1997, we learned that Melaleuca had commissioned experiments on dogs for its nutritional product Provex CV.
It seems that every consumer we speak to has heard a different story from Melaleuca about its removal from our “don’t test” list. One common accusation is that we removed the company from the list for washing its employees’ companion animals with dog shampoo. This is not accurate. Using animals in laboratory settings to test products for safety and trying out a product that has already been proved safe through non-animal testing methods on one’s companion animal are two entirely different situations. We would not take issue with the latter scenario, which does not involve harming animals.
It is important to note that Melaleuca used animals for tests while it was included on PETA’s cruelty-free list—after signing our statement of assurance, which indicates that the company will never test on animals, in 1993. Obviously, Melaleuca is willing to make exceptions to its “no animal testing” policy whenever it deems it necessary.
A March 2003 Melaleuca statement titled “Our Position: Firm but Not Extreme” says, “Melaleuca has long taken the position that we will not test our personal care or household products on animals. We feel that is the proper position to take, and you will find us adhering to this policy without hesitation. We feel, however, that there are extremes to every argument. We do not adhere to the extremes. … Nor do we take the position that all scientific use of animals needs to be stopped.”
In a March 2003 letter, Melaleuca freely admits that it commissioned laboratory tests in which rats and dogs were used, stating, “The rats died a horrible death. … Prior to performing human studies to prove Provex CV’s effectiveness, Melaleuca commissioned that the product be tested on dogs first. … In our quest to save life, we refuse to tell PETA that we will never again test our cardiovascular products on animals.”
"
109,Why don’t some cruelty-free companies include the fact that they are cruelty-free on their products’ labels?,"
There is no definitive answer. Whether or not to indicate that a product is cruelty-free on its label is the choice of the individual company. It may not have been deemed important enough to mention, the label may not have had enough space, or the label’s designer may not have chosen to include that information.
 
The good news is that, regardless of whether or not they have chosen to include this information on their labels, all the companies included on our “don’t test” list have all declared in writing that they do not conduct or commission animal tests on ingredients, formulations, or finished products.  
"
110,Does the Food and Drug Administration require drugs to be tested on animals?,"
The FDA does currently require all new prescription and over-the-counter drugs to be tested on animals before they are marketed even though these tests do not make the drugs safe for humans. Unfortunately, government regulations have not kept pace with science. Modern non-animal tests are quicker, less expensive, and more accurate than the old-fashioned poisoning, blinding, and burning tests developed in the 1920s.
"
111,Do medical students have to dissect or experiment on animals?,"
No. Many leading medical schools, including Harvard, Yale, and Stanford, now use innovative, clinical teaching methods instead of animal laboratories. Harvard Cardiac Anesthesia Practicum, which allows students to observe human heart bypass operations, has eliminated any need for the old dog lab, in which students gave dogs drugs that induced heart attacks. Many students all over the world now graduate without harming any animals. In Great Britain, it is against the law for medical students to practice surgery on animals, and British physicians are as competent as those educated elsewhere.
"
112,"How can non-animal tests show us the complex interactions of cells, tissues, and organs?","
Different species of animals vary so enormously in their reactions to toxins and diseases and in their metabolism of drugs that studies with animals are not good indicators for people. For example, a dose of aspirin that is therapeutic in humans is poisonous to cats and has no effect on fever in horses; benzene causes leukemia in humans but not in mice; insulin produces birth defects in animals but not in humans, and so on. Today’s sophisticated “super” computers can actually predict the effect of substances on all the organs of the human body.
"
113,Don’t most scientists care about animals because their research depends on the animals’ well-being?,"Investigations at our most prestigious institutions show that this is not the case. At the City of Hope in California, one of the country’s most prominent research facilities, animals starved to death and drowned in their own feces. Many experimenters become calloused after years of research and refuse to see the animals’ suffering. They treat animals as disposable tools for research and fight laws that would improve the animals’ care.
"
114,"I’ve seen a few products with labels that say, “This finished product not tested on animals.” Does that mean that the individual ingredients have been tested on animals?","
In cases like these, the product could be completely cruelty-free or the status of the ingredients could be questionable. It depends upon the company.
 
For example, both Bath & Body Works and Aveda use similar statements on their packaging, and neither company tests ingredients on animals. This statement is often used to meet language requirements when products marketed in both the U.S. and the U.K. use the same packaging in both countries.
 
Since most ingredients have been tested on animals by someone at some time in the past, England does not allow a company to include phrases such as “no animal testing” on its products, even if that company has not conducted animal tests on its ingredients.
"
115,What can be done about animal tests that are required by law?,"
Although animal testing of certain pharmaceuticals and chemicals is still mandated by law, the arguments against animals testing of cosmetics and household products are also valid when applied to the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. These industries are regulated by the FDA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), respectively, and it is the responsibility of the companies that kill animals in order to bring their products to market to convince these regulatory agencies that there is a better way to determine product safety. 
 
PETA is actively working on this front by funding the development and validation of testing methods that do not involve animals and by providing input through our involvement on government advisory committees at both the national and international levels. 
 
Companies resist progress because the crude nature of animal testing allows them to market products that might be determined to be too toxic if cell culture tests were used. Let companies know how you feel about this.
"
116,Why do companies continue to test products on animals?,"
Companies test on animals to provide data that they can use to defend themselves when they are sued by injured consumers—even though some courts have ruled that the FDA has failed to show that the results of animal tests can be extrapolated to humans. The unreliability of animal tests allows companies to put virtually any product on the market.
 
If cosmetics or household products blind or poison animals during tests, they are often marketed anyway. Companies use the fact that the products have been tested—rather than the actual test results—to support the claim that they are conscientious. In most cases, companies settle out of court, preferring to pay off the injured consumer rather than bring the unreliability of their testing practices to light. In some cases, courts have ruled in favor of the injured consumers. 
 
In the end, animal tests protect no one.
"
117,Does the law require animal testing for cosmetics and household products?,"
Absolutely not! Neither the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) nor the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission requires that cosmetics or household products be tested on animals. There is sufficient existing safety data, as well as in vitro alternatives, to make animal testing obsolete for these products. While it is true that virtually every ingredient—even water—has been tested on animals in the past, we can help prevent future animal testing by buying only from cruelty-free companies.
"
118,Animals in cages on factory farms or in laboratories don’t suffer that much because they’ve never known anything else.,"Humans and animals alike have instincts that they are born with, regardless of where they are raised. In addition to the physical suffering—muscle pain, skeletal deformities, respiratory illnesses, and other chronic ailments—caused by intensive confinement, being prevented from performing the most basic instinctual behaviors causes tremendous mental anguish. Even animals caged since birth want to move around, groom themselves, stretch their limbs or wings, and exercise. Studies at Bristol University in England revealed that when factory-farmed chickens who grew up crammed into wire cages were freed, they naturally began to dust-bathe and build nests for their eggs. Herd animals and flock animals become distressed when they are made to live in isolation or when they are put in groups too large for them to be able to recognize other members.
In addition, all confined animals suffer from intense boredom—some so severely that it can lead to self-mutilation or other self-destructive behavior, which farmers “solve” by pulling teeth and chopping off beaks and tails.

119,"Is animal experimentation acceptable if it helps animals, too, by advancing veterinary science?","
This is like asking whether it’s acceptable to experiment on poor children to benefit rich ones. The point is not whether animal experimentation can be useful to animals or humans; the point is that we should not inflict suffering on those who are at our mercy. Veterinary medicine, like human medicine, is increasingly dependent upon studies that don’t harm some animals in an effort to help others. These include computer modeling, cell research, epidemiological research, and clinical studies designed to help animals who are already ill.
"
120,"If cats and dogs are going to be killed in pounds anyway, why not let them be used in experiments?","
A painless death at an animal shelter is far better than a life of severe pain and deprivation in a laboratory before being killed by experimenters. Rather than finding more acceptable ways of harming animals in laboratories, we encourage scientists and those who fund them to embrace non-animal research and stop using animals altogether.
"
121,Does animal experimentation save human lives?,"
More lives could be saved and suffering stopped by educating people on the importance of avoiding fat and cholesterol, the dangers of smoking, reducing alcohol and other drug consumption, exercising regularly, and cleaning up the environment than by all the animal tests in the world.
And, as George Bernard Shaw once said, “You do not settle whether an experiment is justified or not by merely showing that it is of some use. The distinction is not between useful and useless experiments, but between barbarous and civilized behavior.” There are some medical problems that can probably only be cured by testing on unwilling people, but we don’t do it because we recognize that it would be wrong. We need to extend this same concern to other living, feeling beings, regardless of what species they may be.
"
122,Hasn’t every major medical advance been attributable to experiments on animals?,"
Medical historians have shown that improved nutrition, sanitation, and other behavioral and environmental factors—not anything learned from animal experiments—are responsible for the decline in deaths since 1900 from the most common infectious diseases and that medicine has had little to do with increased life expectancy. Many of the most important advances in health are attributable to human studies, including the development of anesthesia; bacteriology; germ theory; the stethoscope; morphine; radium; penicillin; artificial respiration; antiseptics; the CAT, MRI, and PET scans; the discovery of the relationships between cholesterol and heart disease and between smoking and cancer; the development of x-rays; and the isolation of the virus that causes AIDS. Animal testing played no role in these and many other developments.
The role of animal studies in the development of many treatments has been exaggerated and twisted to fit the goals of those who promote animal experimentation. For example, the development of the polio vaccine involved two separate bodies of work—the in vitro or non-animal studies, which were awarded the Nobel Prize, and the subsequent animal experiments in which close to 1 million animals were killed and which the Nobel committee refused to recognize as anything more than wasteful. Early polio studies on animals misled researchers about the route of infection and delayed the development of a vaccine for decades.
It’s impossible to say where we would be today if we had refused to experiment on animals, because throughout medical history, very few resources have been devoted to non-animal research methods. We do know that animal experiments frequently give misleading results and many believe we’d probably be better off if we hadn’t relied on them and ignored avenues of research more relevant to humans, including epidemiological and cell research.
"
123,"Would you approve an experiment that would sacrifice 10 animals to save 10,000 people?","
Suppose the only way to save those 10,000 people was to experiment on one mentally challenged orphan. If saving people is the goal, wouldn’t that be worth it? Most people will agree that it is wrong to sacrifice one human for the “greater good” of others because it would violate that individual’s rights. There is no logical reason to deny animals the same rights that protect individual humans from being sacrificed for the common good.
"
124,"If we don’t use animals, wouldn’t we have to test new drugs on people?","
The choice isn’t between animals and people. There’s no guarantee that drugs are safe just because they’ve been tested on animals. Because of the physiological differences between humans and other animals, results from animal tests cannot be accurately extrapolated to humans, leaving us vulnerable to exposure to drugs that can cause serious side effects. Drugs that sicken or kill animals don’t always prevent a drug from being marketed. So much evidence has accumulated about differences in the effects that chemicals have on animals and humans that government officials often do not act on findings from animal studies. In the last two decades, many drugs, including phenacitin, Eferol, Oraflex, Suprol, and Selacryn, were taken off the market after causing hundreds of deaths and/or injuries. In fact, more than half the drugs that the Food and Drug Administration approved between 1976 and 1985 were either removed from the market or relabeled because of serious side effects. If the pharmaceutical industry switched from animal experiments to sophisticated non-animal tests, we would have greater protection, not less.
In addition to saving the lives of countless animals, alternatives to animal tests are efficient and reliable. Non-animal methods usually take less time to complete, can be conducted at a fraction of the cost of the animal experiments that they replace, and are not plagued with species differences that make extrapolation difficult or impossible. Effective, affordable, and humane research methods include studies of human populations, volunteers, and patients as well as sophisticated in vitro, genomic, and computer-modeling techniques.
"
125,Don’t the March of Dimes’ experiments on animals save the lives of children?,"
Birth defects are prevented and babies are saved when research dollars go into effective and relevant research, which comes from studying human problems in human babies, not from sewing kittens’ eyes shut or addicting rats to cocaine, experiments that the March of Dimes has funded. Through the years, animal tests have frequently led scientists in the wrong direction, thus holding back medical progress and prolonging human suffering.
Many charities, including Easter Seals, Birth Defect Research for Children, Child Health Foundation, and the Heimlich Foundation, put all their funds into programs that directly benefit families affected by birth defects and never waste a penny on cruel animal experiments. Forward-thinking health charities fund humane, modern, and effective non-animal research—such as human cell and tissue cultures, complex computer modeling and scanning techniques, and human epidemiological studies—as well as administering care to people who are already sick.

"
126,Should I feel guilty about taking prescription drugs since all of them have been tested on animals?,"PETA advises making kind choices, whenever they’re available to us. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates that prescription drugs be tested on animals. So unfortunately, whether you take these medications or not, this cruel testing will continue. PETA is urging the FDA to remove this archaic requirement—which was instituted more than 50 years ago—and instead adopt animal-free, human-relevant research methods that better predict drug efficacy and toxicity than crude animal tests. PETA is also urging the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to do the same and stop wasting our tax dollars on useless experiments on animals. You can help by asking your congressional representatives to mandate that NIH fund research that uses only animal-free, modern techniques to develop new drugs and other therapies.
"
127,Is there anything wrong with experiments that don’t harm animals?,"
If there really is no harm—when animals are observed in their own environments, for example—we don’t object. But keeping animals isolated in barren steel cages, removed from all that is natural to them, is harmful to animals’ mental and physical health.
"
128,Should we throw out all the drugs that were developed and tested on animals?,"
Unfortunately, many things in our society came about through others’ exploitation. For instance, many of the roads we drive on were built by slaves. We can’t change the past; those who have already suffered and died are lost. What we can do is change the future by using non-animal research methods from now on.
"
129,Aren’t humans natural carnivores?,"
While humans have eaten meat throughout history, there is significant evidence that we are better suited to a vegetarian diet. Carnivorous animals have long, curved fangs, claws, and a short digestive tract. Humans have flat, flexible nails, and our so-called “canine” teeth are minuscule compared to carnivores’. Human teeth are better suited to biting into vegetables, fruits, and grains than tearing through tough hides.
In addition, the health problems associated with meat consumption—a leading contributor to heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and obesity—should be an indication that we aren’t “meant” to eat meat. In addition, humans are capable of making ethical decisions. We can get all the nutrients we need from plant sources, which means that billions of animals are unnecessarily slaughtered every year at the expense of our health and the environment.
"
130,"Animals kill other animals for food, so why shouldn’t we?","
Most of the animals who kill for food could not survive if they didn’t. That is not the case for us. We are better off not eating meat. Many other animals are vegetarians, including some of our closest primate relatives. Why don’t we look to them as our example instead of to carnivores?
"
131,What about kosher symbols?,"This issue is complex, but kosher symbols and markings are not indicators on which vegans or vegetarians should base their purchasing decisions.
"
132,"I believe in protecting animals, but do you have to focus so much on vegetarianism?","
As an animal protection group, PETA cannot in good conscience condone the murder of animals for their flesh, even if our nation’s current meat addiction was not at the root of a staggering number of health problems. (Similarly, the American Cancer Society, for example, could not in good conscience condone the “choice” of cigarette smoking.) The truth is, there is simply no way that animals can be humanely raised and killed for food. The sheer number of animals required to feed America’s current meat habit makes individual attention to their wants and needs impossible.
Ultimately, there is the simple moral principle that we do not have the right to manipulate and kill animals for our own purposes. Animals do not belong to us, and their lives are just as precious to them as yours or mine is to you or me.
"
133,Vegetarianism is a personal choice. Why are you trying to force it on everyone else?,"
From a moral standpoint, actions that harm others are not matters of personal choice. Murder, child abuse, and cruelty to animals are all immoral. Our society now encourages meat-eating and the cruelty of factory farming, but history teaches that society also once encouraged slavery, child labor, and many other practices now universally recognized as wrong.
"
134,The only meat I still eat is fish. Can fish feel pain?,"Research has shown that indeed they can. According to Dr. Donald Broom, animal welfare advisor to the British government, “Anatomically, physiologically, and biologically, the pain system in fish is virtually the same as in birds and mammals.” Fish have fully developed brains and nervous systems and very sensitive mouths. Fish use their tongues and mouths as humans might use their hands—to catch or gather food, build nests, and even hide their offspring from danger. Fish also experience fear. An Australian study found that when fish are chased, confined, or otherwise threatened, they react as humans do to stress: with increased heart and breathing rates and a burst of adrenalin.
 
"
135,"It’s OK to eat eggs because chickens lay them naturally. The eggs we buy in the supermarket are sterile and not unborn fetuses, right?","
The cruelty of egg production lies in the treatment of the “laying” hens themselves, who are perhaps the most abused of all factory-farmed animals. Up to five hens are packed into each cage the size of a filing cabinet drawer. The cages are stacked many tiers high; feces from the cages above fall onto the chickens below. Hens become lame and develop osteoporosis from forced immobility and calcium lost to produce egg shells. Some birds’ feet grow around the wire cage floors; they starve to death because they are unable to reach the food trough. At just 2 years of age, most hens are “spent” and sent to the slaughterhouse. Egg-laying hatcheries have no use for male chicks so they suffocate, decapitate, crush, or grind them up alive.
Each egg from today’s egg factory farms represents 22 hours of hell for a hen.
"
136,"The animals have to die sometime, don’t they?","
Humans do, too, but that doesn’t give us the right to kill them or cause them a lifetime of suffering.
"
137,Are all faux meats and dairy products vegan?,"
No. Be sure to read the ingredient list on the package before making a purchase. Common nonvegan ingredients to look out for are casein, whey, sodium caseinate, honey, egg whites, and cheese.
"
138,"What will we do with all those chickens, cows, and pigs if everyone becomes a vegetarian?","
It’s unrealistic to expect that everyone will stop eating animals overnight. As the demand for meat decreases, the number of animals bred will decrease. Farmers will stop breeding so many animals and will turn to other types of agriculture. When there are fewer of these animals, they will be able to live more natural lives.
"
139,What is a vegan?,"
A vegan (strict vegetarian) does not consume meat, dairy products, eggs, honey, or any product derived from an animal. A vegan diet can (and should) be full of a wide variety of delicious, nutritious foods, including vegetables, grains, nuts, legumes, seeds, and fruits. Vegans don’t wear leather, fur, silk, or wool. Many refuse to use products that are made with animal ingredients, products that are filtered using animal parts (such as some wines, beers, and white sugars), and products that have been tested on animals.
"
140,Isn’t eating meat natural? It’s been going on for thousands of years. Aren’t our bodies designed for it,"
Actually, human bodies are better suited to a vegetarian diet. Carnivorous animals have long, curved fangs, claws, and a short digestive tract. Humans have flat, flexible nails, and our so-called “canine” teeth are minuscule compared to those of carnivores or even compared to vegetarian primates like gorillas and orangutans. Our tiny canine teeth are better suited to biting into fruits than tearing through tough hides. We have flat molars and a long digestive tract suited to a diet of vegetables, fruits, and grain. Eating meat is hazardous to our health; it contributes to heart disease, cancer, and many other health problems.
"
141,How can a vegan get enough vitamin B12?,"Vitamin B12 once occurred naturally on the surfaces of potatoes, beets, and other root vegetables, but the move away from natural fertilizers has caused it to disappear from our soil. Nutritionists recommend that vegans take a commercially available multivitamin or vitamin B12 supplement or eat foods that are fortified with this essential vitamin, such as many breakfast cereals, fortified orange juice and soy milk, and nutritional yeast. The Vegetarian Site offers a variety of B12 supplements in either lozenge or tablet form that make it easy and affordable to get the proper nutrients!
"
142,"If you were starving on a boat at sea and there were an animal on the boat, would you eat the animal?","
I don’t know. Humans will go to extremes to save their own lives, even if it means hurting someone innocent. (People have even killed and eaten other people in such situations.) This example, however, isn’t relevant to our daily choices. For most of us, there is no emergency and no excuse to kill animals for food.
"
143,Was Jesus really a vegetarian?,"Many biblical scholars believe that Jesus was a vegetarian. Jesus’ message is one of love and compassion, and there is nothing loving or compassionate about factory farms and slaughterhouses, where billions of animals live miserable lives and die violent, bloody deaths. Jesus mandates kindness, mercy, compassion, and love for all God’s creation. He would be appalled by the suffering that we inflict on animals just to indulge our acquired taste for their flesh.
We all have a choice. When we sit down to eat, we can add to the level of violence, misery, and death in the world, or we can respect God’s creation with a vegetarian diet.

144,"I’m a college student, and there are very few vegan options in my dining hall. Can you offer any advice?","
When students at the University of California at Berkeley first met with the university’s dining hall service to discuss “veganizing” their cafeteria, they received a lukewarm response. So the students set up a table with petitions right outside the dining hall. Within two weeks, they had collected 1,200 signatures—more than one-fifth of Berkeley’s dorm population! The students’ quest also attracted the attention of local reporters. “The media attention really helped us press our case,” says Leor Jacobi, one of the students who spearheaded the project.
Just four weeks and many meetings later, the university’s administration agreed to provide a fully vegan entrée at every meal. The dining service kicked off day one with an all-vegan lunch, where students sampled vegetarian chili, stir-fry, tofu kabobs, hummus, rigatoni and beans, stew, and raspberry sorbet. “There was an overwhelmingly positive student response, even from those who hadn’t tried this way of eating before,” says Jacobi.

"
145,Is it OK to patronize restaurants and grocery stores that sell animal products?,"
If we refuse to buy vegetarian food from a supermarket or restaurant that sells or serves meat, the message sent to these businesses is simply one less sale of a vegetarian entrée or item. This translates in their minds as less demand for vegetarian foods, which could result in such offerings being removed from the shelves or menus. That would be very bad, indeed!

It’s also a good rule of thumb to fill out a comment card or thank to the manager whenever you’re impressed with a business’s vegetarian selection.
"
146,What are shahtoosh and pashmina?,"
"
147,Isn’t leather better for the environment than synthetics?,
148,What was the rationale behind your “Got Beer?” Campaign?,"
By comparing milk and beer, our aim was not to promote beer-drinking. We made a point of stressing that PETA recommends juices, soy milk, and mineral water—even soda—over milk OR beer. We invoked beer simply to make the point that milk is so awful that even a glass of beer—certainly no health food—is a better choice than a glass of milk! Had we used soda instead of beer, there would have been no media interest in the campaign, of course. As it stands, the widespread media interest allowed us to draw attention to the downside of dairy, something that many people had previously heard little about. In the media interviews generated by this campaign, after the criticism we were able to address these facts, and we stressed that PETA urges everyone, beer-drinkers included, to drink responsibly. Where milk is concerned, there’s no such thing!
"
149,Where can I find leather alternatives?,"Nonleather products are readily available. Many department stores and shoe stores offer nonleather shoes, bags, and other products. In fact, many products that look like leather are actually synthetic (pleather). Just check the label for those magic words: “all man-made materials” or “synthetic.”

"
150,What are some alternatives to wool?,"
As the many people who are allergic to wool already know, alternatives to wool clothing and blankets are readily available. Cotton flannel, polyester fleece, and other synthetic fibers wash easily, keep their bright colors, cost less, and don’t contribute to cruelty. We include a number of companies that sell wool alternatives in our “Guide to Compassionate Clothing.” Click here to view the guide online.

151,Are products made with feathers inhumane?,"
"
152,I’ve heard that the Indian leather industry is really cruel. Is it really so bad?,"Since slaughtering cows and buffalos is illegal under most circumstances in all but a few states in India, the cows are marched over hot, dusty roads for 50 to 100 miles, across state lines to locations where they can be loaded onto trucks and taken to slaughter.
 
Typically, up to 24 animals are crammed into trucks meant for only six to seven, so cattle must climb over one another to find any space, inadvertently gouging each other with their horns, trampling and crushing those beneath them. Horns are broken off and nose rings ripped out. Extreme crowding is particularly cruel when temperatures soar, leading to heat exhaustion and suffocation.
 
Many animals are so sick and injured by the time they arrive at the slaughterhouse, they must be dragged inside. Others have hot chili peppers and tobacco rubbed into their eyes and their tail bones painfully twisted and broken just to make them stand up. Some animals have their legs cut off or are skinned while still alive.
 
Because of this cruelty, more and more people in India, in the U.S., and around the world are refusing to buy leather. In this technologically advanced time, it’s easy to find inexpensive, quality shoes and accessories that are stylish and free of animal suffering.

153,How is down obtained?,"Typically, ducks and geese are lifted by their necks, their legs tied, and their feathers are ripped out. The struggling birds often sustain injuries during plucking. They are then returned to their cage until they are ready to be plucked again. This process begins when the animals are 8 weeks old and is repeated at eight-week intervals until the birds are slaughtered.
Feathers are often plucked out of ducks and geese raised for food. Those raised for foie gras, especially, suffer terribly. They are force-fed—a funnel is inserted into each bird’s throat, and up to 6 pounds of a salty, fatty corn mash is pumped into the stomach each day—until the bird’s liver has ballooned to four times the normal size.
Synthetic alternatives to down are not only cruelty-free, they are also cheaper and, unlike down, retain their insulating capabilities in all weather conditions. For more information, see PETA’s factsheet on down.
"
154,My school is planning a donkey basketball game to raise money. Are these games cruel to the donkeys?,"Animals do not comprehend or willingly participate in sporting events. Yet donkeys are often prodded around school gymnasiums, kicked, whipped, and screamed at by young, impressionable students who are more concerned with winning the game and showing off for their friends then with the animals’ well-being.
The donkeys are dragged from school to school and are usually not given food and water beforehand so that they don’t have “accidents” during the games. The deprivation, constant travel, unfamiliar surroundings, loud noise, and rough handling are extremely stressful for the donkeys. They often develop unpredictable temperaments and have been known to lash out in frustration or fear, causing injury to participants or bystanders. 
The games may desensitize young people to animal suffering and teach them that we have the right to abuse animals for our own entertainment. Animals should not have to pay the price at school fundraisers. There are countless humane and fun ways to raise school funds. After all, what kid doesn’t love dunking the science teacher or pieing the principal?
 
"
155,"What are “bloodless” or Portuguese bullfights, and are they legal in the U.S.?","
So-called “bloodless” bullfights, legal in many U.S. states, involve teasing and attacking the bull. Although tormenting and abusing the animal is part of the show, killing must be done outside the arena. But just like regular bullfights, bloodless bullfights send the message that animals are nothing more than objects for us to abuse at will.
"
156,Where do captive animals come from?,"Animals held captive in zoos, circuses, aquariums, laboratories, and canned hunting ranches are often stolen from the wild or are bred in captivity. After animals in circuses, for example, have outlived their usefulness as performers, they are either permanently relegated to winter quarters (often cages) or are sold to other circuses, zoos, private menageries, game farms (where they are shot for “recreation” or for “exotic” meat), or even research laboratories.
We at PETA prefer to learn about animals on their terms, in their own natural environments—not at their expense. To learn more about what goes on behind the scenes at circuses, aquariums, zoos, and other facilities, see PETA’s factsheets on the use of animals in the “entertainment” industry.
"
157,Is there any reason I shouldn’t buy a pearl necklace?,"
A pearl is an ulcer that is formed when an irritant, such as a parasite, enters an oyster, who responds by coating it with nacre (a crystalline substance that gives pearls their luster). Stress is what prompts an oyster to secrete nacre (just like stress creates human ulcers).
Because pearls naturally form in only one in 10,000 oysters and because the creation of a pearl can take up to three years, pearl-makers have devised a process called “culturing,” or cultivating, that allows them to exploit oysters faster and cheaper.
Culturing involves surgically opening each oyster shell and inserting an irritant in the oyster. Freshwater pearls are cultured by inserting another oyster’s mantle tissue. Saltwater pearls have beads and another oyster’s mollusk tissue inserted. Fewer than half of the oysters may survive this process.
Cultivators further stress the oysters by suspending them in water in a cage, washing their shells, moving them around in different waters, and raising and lowering their cages to subject them to changing water temperatures. 
After the pearls are extracted from the oysters, one-third of oysters are “recycled” and put through the culturing process again. The others are killed and discarded.
For those concerned about the environment, there is another reason to avoid pearls. Aquaculture has contributed to destruction of natural pearl oyster beds from pollution and overharvesting.
Of course, with so many modern pearl imitations, as well as other kinds of jewelry, it’s easy to do without pearls.
"
158,God put animals here for us to use; the Bible gives us dominion over animals.,"
Dominion is not the same as tyranny. The queen of England has “dominion” over her subjects, but that doesn’t mean she can eat them, wear them, or experiment on them. If we have dominion over animals, surely it is to protect them, not to abuse them for our own ends. There is nothing in the Bible that would justify our modern-day policies that desecrate the environment, destroy entire species of wildlife, and inflict torment and death on billions of animals every year. The Bible imparts a reverence for life; a loving God could not help but be appalled at the way His creatures are being treated. For more information, please visit JesusVeg.com.
"
159,Where do you draw the line?,"
The renowned humanitarian Albert Schweitzer, who accomplished so much for humans and animals in his lifetime, would take time to stoop and move a worm from hot pavement to cool earth. Aware of the problems and responsibilities an expanded ethic brings with it, he said we each must “live daily from judgment to judgment, deciding each case as it arises, as wisely and mercifully as we can.” We can’t stop all suffering, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t stop any. In today’s world of virtually unlimited choices, there are usually “kinder, gentler” ways for most of us to feed, clothe, entertain, and educate ourselves than by killing animals.
"
160,"What about all the customs, traditions, and jobs that depend on using animals?","
The invention of the automobile, the abolition of slavery, and the end of World War II also necessitated job retraining and restructuring. This is simply an ingredient in all social progress—not a reason to deter progress.
"
161,Wasn’t Hitler in favor of animal rights?,"
Contrary to myth, Hitler wasn’t a vegetarian. Although the Nazis purported to pass an anti-vivisection bill, they did not. In fact, they were required by law to first perform their experiments on animals before carrying them out on humans. Experiments on humans did not replace animal experiments; on the contrary, animal experiments made them possible. John Vyvyan, in The Dark Face of Science, summed it up this way: “The experiments made on prisoners were many and diverse, but they had one thing in common: All were in continuation of or complementary to experiments on animals. In every instance, this antecedent scientific literature is mentioned in the evidence; and at Buchenwald and Auschwitz concentration camps, human and animal experiments were carried out simultaneously as parts of a single programme.” 
However, even if this weren’t the case, the merits of an idea cannot be determined by the character of its proponents. If Hitler believed in the theory of relativity, does that mean we should not believe in it? What if Gandhi also believed in the theory of relativity—how would we reconcile the two? An idea must be judged on its own merits.
"
162,What about people who have to hunt to survive?,"
We have no quarrel with aboriginal subsistence hunters and fishers who truly have no choice in order to survive. However, in this day and age, meat, fur, and leather are not a necessary part of survival for the vast majority of us.
"
163,Isn’t hunting okay as long as I eat what I kill?,"Did the fact that Jeffrey Dahmer ate his victims justify his crimes? What is done with the corpse after a murder doesn’t lessen the victim’s suffering. Furthermore, hunters are harming animals other than the ones they kill and take home. Those who don’t die outright often suffer disabling injuries. Additionally, the stress that hunting inflicts on animals—the noise, the fear, and the constant chase—severely restricts their ability to eat adequately and to store the fat and energy they need to survive the winter. Hunting also disrupts migration and hibernation. For animals like wolves, who mate for life and have close-knit families, hunting can severely harm entire communities.
"
164,"It’s fine for you to believe in animal rights, but you shouldn’t tell other people what to do.","
Hey, now you are telling me what to do! Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but freedom of thought does not always imply freedom of action. You are free to believe whatever you want as long as you don’t hurt others. You may believe that animals should be killed, that black people should be enslaved, or that women should be beaten, but you don’t always have the right to put your beliefs into practice. As for telling people what to do, society exists because there are rules governing people’s behavior.
The very nature of reform movements is to “tell others what to do”—don’t use humans as slaves, don’t sexually harass women, etc.—and all movements initially encounter opposition from people who want to go on doing the criticized behavior.
"
165,Do vegans support any political party or endorse any political candidates?,"
PETA is nonpartisan. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, educational organization, IRS regulations prohibit us from endorsing a particular candidate or party. We do, however, work with legislators of all party affiliations and recognize the accomplishments of politicians who have helped pass laws protecting animals, regardless of their party.
"
166,What’s veganism's position on the Animal Liberation Front (ALF)?,"
Throughout history, some people have felt the need to break the law in order to fight injustice. The Underground Railroad and the French Resistance are both examples of people breaking the law in order to combat injustice. PETA is a legal activist organization, but we realize that other groups have different methods and we try not to condemn any efforts in behalf of animals in which no one is harmed. “The ALF,” which is simply the name adopted by people acting illegally in behalf of animal rights, breaks inanimate objects such as stereotaxic devices and decapitators in order to save lives. It burns empty buildings in which animals are tortured and killed. ALF “raids” have provided proof of horrific cruelty that would not have been discovered or believed otherwise.
They have resulted in officials’ filing of criminal charges against laboratories, the citing of experimenters for violations of the Animal Welfare Act, and, in some cases, the shutting down of abusive labs for good. Often ALF raids have been followed by widespread scientific condemnation of the practices occurring in the targeted labs. Anyone can be an activist. It does not take any special skills or superhuman abilities. You just need to care enough about animals to want to help them.
"
167,What is veganism's stance on abortion?,"
PETA does not have a position on the abortion issue, because our focus as an organization is the alleviation of the suffering inflicted on nonhuman animals. There are people on both sides of the abortion issue in the animal rights movement, just as there are people on both sides of animal rights issues in the pro-life movement. And just as the pro-life movement has no official position on animal rights, neither does the animal rights movement have an official position on abortion.
"
168,Do vegans advocate the use of violence?,"PETA maintains a creed of nonviolence and does not advocate actions in which anyone, human or nonhuman, is injured. We are a legal activist organization that works to educate the public about the horrors of cruelty to animals through peaceful, nonviolent means. No one has ever been killed through animal rights activity in the United States. To the contrary, when you take a body count, you’ll find that it’s the animal protectionists who have been harmed: Dian Fossey, Chico Mendez, George Adamson, and park rangers all over the world have been shot or beaten to death because of their work for animals.
"
169,What is veganism's stance on gun control?,"
The only position PETA has on guns is that they should not be used to hunt animals. PETA has objected to some of the National Rifle Association’s positions in the past, because it frequently takes pro-hunting stands and lobbies against bills that would restrict or ban hunting. However, our disagreement with the organization is limited to hunting issues and doesn’t extend to gun control or gun ownership issues.
"
170,I can’t bear to look at some of the graphic photos you use. Can’t you tone it down a little?,"
There are several reasons we publicize photos taken from inside laboratories, factory farms, and other facilities. First, many people simply do not want to believe the extent of animal abuse occurring in our society. The old adage about a picture being worth a thousand words is particularly true in the case of cruelty to animals. Second, with visual evidence of such abuses, we can easily counter the claims of exaggeration made by the industries responsible for these abuses. Additionally, the photos and written materials included in our mailings are intended to make people angry enough to want to act. Anger plays an important role in motivating people to sit down and write letters to their lawmakers, newspapers, or local authorities demanding an end to animal abuse. Please, try not to blame the “messenger.” Hiding the cruelty from people who truly care enough to make a difference doesn’t make these terrible things go away. We urge you to direct your anger at those who are truly deserving of it—the perpetrators of these hideous crimes.
Remember, as disturbing as it is to see this abuse, we only have to look at the pictures—the animals have to live it. They will have truly died in vain if they die without anyone documenting their suffering and shouting the injustice of it to the world. The animals are counting on us to do all we can to publicize their plight and motivate others to help them. If the photos really are too much for you, please consider passing our literature on to others who need such proof. Give PETA literature to your local library, put it on a table in the lunchroom at work, or leave it in the free literature stacks at a local bookstore, health food store, or college campus center.

171,Is it OK to eat roadkill?,"If people must eat animal carcasses, roadkill is a superior option to the neatly shrink-wrapped plastic packages of meat in the supermarket.
Eating roadkill is healthier for the consumer than meat laden with antibiotics, hormones, and growth stimulants, as most meat is today. It is also more humane in that animals killed on the road were not castrated, dehorned, or debeaked without anesthesia, did not suffer the trauma and misery of transportation in a crowded truck in all weather extremes, and did not hear the screams and smell the fear of the animals ahead of them on the slaughter line. Perhaps the animals never knew what hit them.

173,Where do zoos get their animals?,"Zoos breed their animals or acquire them from other zoos. Babies are great crowd-pleasers, but when the babies grow up, they don’t attract the same number of people, so zoos often sell them off in order to make room for younger animals. The unwanted adult animals are sometimes sold to “game” farms where hunters pay to kill them; some are killed for their meat and/or hides. Other “surplus” animals may be sold to smaller, more poorly run zoos or, worse, to laboratories for experiments.
For more information, see PETA’s factsheet about zoos.

174,"If animals aren’t meant to be eaten, why are they made of meat?","Perhaps a more appropriate question would be: If humans have hearts and brains, why don’t we use them? Because if we did, we would see that animals aren’t so very different from us. They clearly show affection, fear, joy, the desire to live, and more. They aren’t emotion-less machines whose lives are inconvenient stages on the way to our dinner table. They are living, breathing, feeling beings who want to lead their own lives just as people do. Once we recognize this, then it’s easy to turn to a diet free of decaying bits of corpses.
It’s also just plain old good sense to reject a cholesterol-laden diet linked to heart disease, stroke, and many cancers and switch to healthier, delicious veggies, grains, fruits, and legumes. Please request a free copy of PETA’s vegetarian starter kit.

175,"I used to like to visit animals at the zoo, but they seem so sad. How do vegans feel about zoos?","Zoo officials often consider profits ahead of the animals’ well-being. A former director of the Atlanta Zoo once remarked that he was “too far removed from the animals; they’re the last thing I worry about with all the other problems.” Zoos teach people that it is acceptable to keep animals in captivity, bored, cramped, lonely, far from their natural homes, and at the mercy and whim of people.
Zoos claim to educate people, but most zoo enclosures are quite small, and labels provide little more information than the species’ name, diet, and natural range. The animals’ normal behavior is seldom discussed, much less observed, because their natural needs are seldom met in the zoo environment. The many animals who naturally live in large herds or family groups are often kept alone or, at most, in pairs. Natural hunting and mating behaviors are virtually eliminated by regulated feeding and breeding regimens. The animals are closely confined, lack privacy, and have little opportunity for mental stimulation or physical exercise, resulting in abnormal and self-destructive behavior, called zoochosis. Not only is this not educational, we believe a true desire to learn about animals should be motivated by and in keeping with a genuine interest in the animals’ well-being.

176,Why should we worry about animals when there are so many problems involving humans?,"There are very serious problems in the world that deserve our attention; but these issues do not diminish the urgency of our cause or any other. Fortunately, PETA’s pro-animal activities have great power to better the human condition as well.
As vegetarians, we advocate eating lower on the food chain, which not only would save 9 billion animals from slaughter each year, but also would save humans from a diet known to cause heart disease, cancer, and obesity. Instead of feeding grain to livestock, a plant-based diet makes 16 times more grain available to hungry people. Eliminating intensive factory farming of animals would save precious water and topsoil; in addition, without the ozone-damaging nitrates resulting from billions of pounds of manure, our air would be cleaner and we would take a giant step toward fighting global warming. In this way, animals, humans, and the environment are interconnected—we all stand to gain by not harming animals.

178,Hunting is much less cruel than factory farming.,"Yes, and Jack the Ripper was less cruel than Hitler—that didn’t make him a nice guy. It is true that killing an animal in the wild is less cruel than the months of torture animals endure on factory farms. However, hunting, like farming, disrupts families and causes pain, trauma, and grief to both the victims and the survivors. Why cause any suffering when we can avoid it?
"
179,"Most animals used for food, fur, or experiments are bred for that purpose.","
Unfortunately, somebody forgot to tell the animals that! They insist on behaving as if their lives were important to them, and nobody else. Breeding animals for certain purposes may help us feel better about mistreating them, but it doesn’t change the animals’ biological ability to feel pain and fear.

180,What’s wrong with drinking milk? Don’t dairy cows need to be milked?,"In order for a cow to produce milk, she must have a calf. “Dairy” cows are impregnated every year in order to keep up a steady supply of milk. In the natural order of things, the cow’s calf would drink her milk (eliminating her need to milked by humans). But dairy cows’ babies are taken away within a day or two of birth so that humans can have the milk that nature intended for their calves. Female dairy calves may be slaughtered immediately or raised to be future dairy cows. Male dairy calves are confined for 16 weeks to tiny veal crates too small for them even to turn around in so that their flesh, sold as veal, will be atrophied and nonmuscular. Then these weak, 4-month-old youngsters are sent to the slaughterhouse.
The current high demand for dairy products requires that cows be pushed far beyond their natural physical limits, genetically engineered and fed growth hormones in order to produce huge quantities of milk. Even the few farmers who choose not to raise animals intensively must both eliminate the calf (who would otherwise drink the milk) and send the mother to an early death when her milk production wanes. 
"
181,My friend has chickens and they’re treated very well. Is it ok to eat their eggs?,"If you have a close friend or family member who keeps rescued chickens as companions and doesn’t breed or sell them or their eggs, and whose home you have visited personally to ensure the birds’ welfare, then you are not hurting the chickens by eating the eggs that the birds lay naturally. However, it would greatly help other chickens if the eggs were given to people who would otherwise consume eggs from factory-farmed birds.
Of course, the healthiest choice is to avoid all eggs—and it’s easy, too! Click here for information on egg replacers.

182,Do vegans have an office in Canada?,"Right now, we are unable to open an office in Canada, but we are quite active there and have a dedicated activist network.

"
183,What should I do if animals are being abused in my local pet store?,"There are few federal laws that regulate the sale of animals in pet stores, but stores must adhere to state and local laws. You can obtain a copy of local laws by doing an Internet search (these laws can be found at www.animal-law.org, while codes for particular cities are available at www.municode.com, and all should be available at your local library) to help guide you in identifying possible violations at a pet store in your area.

"
184,Is it OK for vegetarians to eat shrimp?,"There are certain creatures—like scallops, oysters, and shrimp—that we just don’t know a whole lot about. We aren’t sure how much pain and suffering they are capable of feeling. Here at PETA, we urge people to “err on the side of compassion.” Since we don’t know for sure that these creatures can’t suffer, we opt to assume they do and act accordingly.
An equally pressing reason to avoid sea “food” of all kinds is the issue of bycatch. When fishers seek a certain quarry, they often injure and kill other sea creatures in the process. In the case of shrimp, sea turtles are often caught and killed in the shrimp nets. This is a huge contributor to the decline in the sea turtle population.
Another reason to avoid eating sea creatures of any kind is the fact that fishing has had a devastating effect on the world’s oceans. This means that food is scarce not only for humans, but also for the other animals, such as seals, dolphins, and sea birds, who survive on what they catch in the sea. When we catch huge quantities of sea creatures, we reduce the food source for these animals, who, unlike most humans, truly must consume fish and other sea creatures in order to survive.

185,Why do vegans give fur coats to the homeless?,"Donating unwanted furs that have been marked with red paint to homeless people not only helps needy people keep warm, it also allows us to counteract reports of a “fur comeback” by showcasing that we are receiving more donations of fur than ever before from people appalled at the cruelty involved in fur ranching and trapping. In media interviews resulting from fur giveaways, we are able to point out that, even after using hundreds of furs in educational displays, dumping them at museums and outside furriers’ stores, painting them for floats, dragging them through the streets, burying and burning them, and even donating them to wildlife rehabilitators for use as animal bedding, we still have plenty of coats left over.
Fur giveaways also counteract furriers’ efforts to portray fur as “upscale,” “chic,” or a status symbol; rather, the overwhelming influx of fur into our office means that fur has hit rock bottom.
"
186,What’s Wrong With Crating Dogs and Puppies?,"Most people don’t realize that animals who are caged for extended periods of time often become aggressive, withdrawn, hyperactive, and/or severely depressed, and they can also develop other problems, such as eating disorders. Crating for extended periods of time prevents dogs from fulfilling some of their most basic needs, including walking around, relieving themselves, and stretching.
There are numerous humane alternatives to crating for people whose schedules force them to leave their canine companions at home during the workday, including humane training, which teaches guardians effective ways to communicate with their animal companions. It is also vital that dogs get plenty of exercise, preferably in the morning (at least 45 minutes for a young dog)—tired dogs want to sleep, not “redecorate” the living room. Dogs should get at least one long walk every day, as well as several shorter walks and vigorous play sessions.

Dogs should not be expected to “hold it” all day while their guardians are at work. If you cannot return home during the day to provide a bathroom break for your dog, we recommend hiring a reputable dog-walking or pet-sitting service or asking a reliable friend or neighbor to take your dog out for a midday walk. A “doggie door” that provides access to a secure, fenced yard can also give dogs a way to relieve themselves and alleviate boredom, which will help prevent neuroses. And doggie daycare centers are popping up all over—they can provide dogs with a fun and safe place to socialize and enjoy their time while their guardians are away.
"
187,Does eating meat really cause impotence?,"Medical evidence indicates that meat-eating does indeed cause impotence, because meat clogs up the arteries going to all organs, not just to the heart. Meat-eating is also linked to numerous other health problems, including heart disease, cancer, and stroke. But it seems that many men care more about their virility than their longevity, so we’re appealing to them on their terms.

188,"I love seeing the animals at the circus, and they don’t seem to mind performing. Why do vegans protest the use of animals in circuses?","According to Ringling Bros. founder Henry Ringling North, in his book, The Circus Kings, tigers and lions are “chained to their pedestals, and ropes are put around their necks to choke them down. They work from fear.” He also writes that trainers commonly break bears’ noses or burn their paws to force them to stand on their hind legs, that lions and tigers are routinely choked with ropes to make them behave, and that monkeys and chimpanzees are struck with trainers’ clubs while they scream.
The fact is, animals do not naturally ride bicycles, stand on their heads, balance on balls, or jump through rings of fire. To force them to perform these confusing and physically uncomfortable tricks, trainers use whips, tight collars, muzzles, electric prods, bullhooks, and other painful tools of the trade.
We applaud the trapeze artists, jugglers, clowns, tightrope-walkers, and acrobats, but let’s leave the animals in peace. Sweden, Denmark, Finland, India, and the U.K. have all banned or restricted the use of animals in entertainment—it’s time for the U.S. to do the same.

190,"Animals don’t reason, don’t understand rights, and don’t always respect our rights, so why should we apply our ideas of morality to them?","
An animal’s inability to understand and adhere to our rules is as irrelevant as a child’s or a person with a developmental disability’s inability to do so. Like small children, most animals are not capable of choosing to change their behavior, but adult human beings have the intelligence to choose between behavior that hurts others and behavior that doesn’t.

192,Don’t zoos help to preserve endangered species?,"Most animals confined in zoos are not endangered, nor are they being prepared for release into natural habitats. In fact, it is nearly impossible to release captive-bred animals, including threatened species like elephants, polar bears, gorillas, tigers and chimpanzees into the wild. Zoos aren’t breeding animals with the intent of replenishing threatened populations: Babies bring visitors through the gates, and captive breeding gives the public a false sense of security about a species’ survival. But that belief undermines support for and diverts resources from in-situ conservation efforts.
A 2015 study published in the Journal of Applied Ecology concluded that unless animals in the wild are protected, captive breeding won’t make a difference.
Lead researcher Dr Paul Dolman said: “Our research challenges the assumption that when a species is perilously close to extinction in the wild, it is always a good idea to set up a captive breeding population … Without conservation in the wild there is no point in captive breeding.”
If wildlife as we know it is to survive, the zoo community must quickly and systematically shift focus from breeding more animals to keep in cages and tanks, to directing attention to the root causes of why animals all over the world are in peril: habitat destruction, poaching, and the exotic animal trade.
People who want to make a difference can support groups such as the International Primate Protection League, the Born Free Foundation, and other organizations that work to preserve habitats, not habits. We should also help nonprofit sanctuaries, like The Elephant Sanctuary, Performing Animal Welfare Society and The Wild Animal Sanctuary that rescue and care for exotic animals but don’t sell or breed them.

193,My neighbor keeps threatening to hurt my companion animals. How can I stop him?,"By keeping your animals safe indoors with you! Those who permit their animals to roam the neighborhood, defecate on others’ property, or bark all day put their animals at risk of being harmed. Don’t wait for a visit from animal control, for a court summons, or, worst of all—for frustrated neighbors to take the “law” into their own hands. Take threats seriously—don’t assume your neighbor is bluffing. Your animal will pay a high price in suffering if you’re wrong! If your animal has already been injured, please click here for information on seeking justice.
Keep your animals out of harm’s way by following these guidelines:
• Follow local and state public health, animal control, and animal cruelty laws, and ensure that your animals have all legally required licenses and vaccinations.
• Pick up waste regularly, and dispose of it properly to eliminate odors.
• Don’t allow your animals outside unsupervised. If your cat roams the neighborhood or your dog spends all day outdoors alone in a yard, bring them inside. Cats and dogs alike should only be allowed outside into a securely fenced yard or on a leash, with you there to keep a careful watch over them.
"
194,Farmers have to treat their animals well or they won’t produce as much milk or lay as many eggs.,"Animals on factory farms do not gain weight, lay eggs, and produce milk because they are comfortable, content, or well cared for but, rather, because they have been manipulated specifically to do these things through genetics, medications, hormones, and management techniques. In addition, animals raised for food today are slaughtered at extremely young ages, usually before disease and misery have decimated them.
Such huge numbers of animals are raised for food that it is less expensive for farmers to absorb some losses than it is to provide humane conditions.

197,Can I get enough protein as a vegan?,"A wealth of evidence shows that vegans need not worry about getting enough protein; if you eat a reasonably varied diet and sufficient calories, you will undoubtedly get enough protein. The average person who eats animal products eats about double the protein that his or her body needs, and there is medical evidence to show that eating too much protein can lead to serious health problems. In addition, unlike animal products, vegan foods have absolutely no cholesterol and hardly any saturated fat.

"
198,What about insects and other “pests”?,"All animals have feelings and have a right to live free from unnecessary suffering—regardless of whether they are considered “pests” or “ugly.”
As with our dealings with our fellow humans, the determination of when lethal defense against insects and animals is acceptable must be judged on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the level of the threat and the alternatives that are available. As Albert Schweitzer once said “Each of us must live daily from judgment to judgment, deciding each case as it arises as wisely and mercifully as we can.”
We realize that aggressive methods of defense must sometimes be resorted to under dire circumstances, whether the attacker is a flea, a bear, or a knife-wielding mugger. But PETA encourages nonlethal methods of insect and rodent control whenever possible.
Fortunately, you can control most insects safely and naturally with products that you probably have in your kitchen cabinets right now.
Ants in your kitchen, bathroom, or basement? Pour a line of cream of tartar, red chili powder, paprika, or dried peppermint at the place where ants enter the house—they won’t cross it. You can also try washing countertops, cabinets, and floors with equal parts vinegar and water.
If cockroaches have moved in, place whole bay leaves in several locations around the infested rooms, including inside kitchen cabinets. Bay leaves smell like dirty socks to cockroaches! For a serious infestation, you may need to resort to an insect growth regulator, called Gentrol, which nips the cockroach reproductive cycle in the bud (cockroaches exposed to it produce sterile offspring).
Mosquitos have few friends when the weather heats up .Taking B-complex vitamins or eating brewer’s yeast daily (including taking it in tablet form) during the summer months will help keep you mosquito-bite-free. Oil of citronella and oil of pennyroyal mint are both effective repellents when diluted with vodka or vegetable oil and dabbed on the skin. Mosquitos also hate the smell of fresh basil, so consider placing a few basil plants around your house.
A humane and great-smelling alternative to mothballs is to place cedar chips around clothes or store sachets made out of dried lavender or equal parts dried rosemary and mint in drawers and closets. To repel flies, hang clusters of cloves in a room, or leave an orange skin out. Click here to view PETA’s factsheet on safely combatting fleas.
Are there spiders sharing your home? If you must evict them, carefully trap them in an inverted jar and release them outside. If you find predators such as ladybugs, snakes, and praying mantises in your yard or garden, the best policy is to let them stay—they’ll help eliminate other “pests.”
Whatever you do, don’t buy cruel glue traps to catch mice. Mice die slowly in these sticky contraptions, breaking tiny limbs in an effort to escape or suffocating to death when their faces become mired in the glue. See PETA’s factsheet on glue traps for more information. Visit PETAMall.com to order a humane box trap that can be used to release mice, unharmed, outdoors.
Don’t give insects or rodents a food supply; keep living areas clean. Be careful to sweep up crumbs, wash dishes immediately, store food in tightly sealed containers, and empty garbage frequently. Often this will be enough to make unwelcome guests move on in search of better accommodations. Prevent insects and mice from entering your home in the first place by filling holes and cracks in walls with white glue or caulk.

199,Can shellfish feel pain?,"
Yes. Scientists have proved beyond a doubt that fish, lobsters, crabs, and other sea dwellers feel pain. Lobsters’ bodies are covered with chemoreceptors so they are very sensitive to their environments. Boiling lobsters alive is particularly cruel. A lobster’s ideal body temperature is between 38 and 42 degrees Fahrenheit; when lobsters are packed on ice, they sometimes “drop” a claw in order to conserve body heat. As many people have discovered, when dropped into boiling water, lobsters will frantically scrape the sides of the pot in a futile attempt to escape. If grocery stores kept live pigs or chickens crammed together in filthy glass tanks with accompanying recipes suggesting that the animals be dropped into a pot of scalding water, consumers would be outraged. These acts are equally deserving of outrage when perpetrated on shellfish.
"
200,Don’t scientists care about the animals they experiment on? Doesn’t their research depend on the animals’ well-being?,"Investigations at even the most prestigious institutions show that this is simply not the case. At the City of Hope in California, one of the country’s most prominent research facilities, animals starved to death and drowned in their own feces. Many experimenters become calloused after years of research and don’t see the animals’ suffering. They treat animals like disposable tools and consider proper animal care to be too expensive.

201,What’s wrong with the rodeo?,"Rodeo performers have been documented beating, kicking, and shocking normally docile cows and horses in chutes and holding pens. “Bucking broncos” and steers are provoked with electric prods, sharp sticks, caustic ointments, and the pinching “bucking” strap. By the time the animals are released into the arena, they are frantic. Calves, roped when running, have their necks snapped back by the lasso, often resulting in neck and back injuries, bruises, broken bones, and internal bleeding.
After their short and painful “careers,” animals in rodeos are sent to the slaughterhouse. Dr. C.G. Haber, a veterinarian who spent 30 years as a federal meat inspector, describes the animals discarded from rodeos for slaughter as being “so extensively bruised that the only areas in which the skin was attached [to the flesh] was the head, neck, leg, and belly. I have seen animals with six to eight ribs broken from the spine and, at times, puncturing the lungs. I have seen as much as 2 to 3 gallons of free blood accumulated under the detached skin.”
Every national animal protection organization opposes rodeos because of their inherent cruelty. Urge your community to buck the rodeo. For more information, click here.

202,"Why shouldn’t people drink milk and eat dairy products? Cows don’t need to be killed to produce milk, right?","At least 5 million cows raised for milk in the United States live on factory farms under conditions that cause them tremendous suffering. They do not graze contentedly in fields; they live in cramped, concrete-floored milking pens where they are milked by machines that often cause cuts and injuries that would not occur if people did the milking.
In addition, while many consumers have heard about the cruelty of the veal industry, most people don’t know that the dairy and veal industries are inextricably linked. Cows, like humans, only give milk after they’ve had a baby. Thus, in the eyes of the farmer, the cows’ offspring are simply a byproduct of this milk-production cycle. Perhaps the greatest pain suffered by cows in the dairy industry is the repeated loss of their young, which is quite traumatic to these extremely maternal animals. Female calves may join the ranks of the milk producers, but the males are generally taken from their mothers within 24 hours of birth and sold at auction either for the notorious veal industry or to beef producers.
Within 60 days, the cow will be impregnated again. For about seven months of her next nine-month pregnancy, the cow will continue to be milked for the fluid meant for her older calf—and this cycle is repeated until her milk production wanes, at which time she is sent to slaughter, most likely to be ground up into fast-food burgers. Calves will continue to suffer as long as there is a market for dairy products. 
"
203,Are animal experiments valuable to AIDS research?,"As many doctors and scientists have realized, relying on animal experiments to find cures for human diseases is an impediment to progress. Researchers have spent years trying to develop an animal “model” for AIDS, yet no animal infected with the AIDS virus has ever developed the disease as humans do. Furthermore, the isolation and stressful living conditions of the animals used in this type of research can impair the animals’ immune systems, affecting the results of the experiment.
Progress in understanding AIDS has come from clinical, epidemiological, and in vitro studies. Even assuming that an animal model of AIDS may someday be developed, testing vaccines for the AIDS virus on animals stands little chance of proving that these drugs will be effective or even safe for humans.

205,What do vegans eat?,"Vegan diets tend to be more colorful and varied than meat-based diets—vegans can enjoy just about every dish a meat-eater can by cooking with veggie burgers, “ham,” “hot dogs,” and “turkey” made out of soy and with less familiar staples such as tofu, tempeh, textured vegetable protein (TVP), and seitan. These can be added to spaghetti, soups, salads, lasagna, stir-fries, and chili.
Many vegans take advantage of delicious ethnic cuisine, such as Chinese, Indian, Thai, and Mexican, and convenience foods, such as instant soup, frozen “TV dinners,” flavored rice mixes, and canned soup (many black bean, minestrone, and vegetable varieties are vegan).
Vegans eat baked and refried beans and pizza without cheese but piled high with vegetable toppings like peppers, mushrooms, or even artichokes or pineapple. Vegans bake with egg replacers, soy flour, and mashed tofu.

206,"I’m interested in becoming more involved in the fight to end animal abuse, but I’m not sure where to start.","The first step anyone can take to prevent animal suffering is to stop using animal products—food and clothing—and those products that have been tested on animals. Writing letters to publications, legislators, and businesses helps to get the message out. Organizing or participating in local demonstrations is also a terrific way to get involved. Even putting bumper stickers on your car can grab someone’s attention and make him or her think. Be creative!
Some savvy activists leave PETA brochures at their doctor’s office or on a plane. Others have invited friends to a vegan potluck dinner. Consider joining local animal or vegetarian groups and setting up information tables to distribute materials. PETA offers a variety of literature for distribution.
If you’d like to get even more involved, PETA has an activist network that you can join. As part of the network, you’ll be informed of events taking place in your area and local issues.

207,What’s wrong with wearing leather? Aren’t the cows going to be slaughtered for meat anyway?,"This is a common misconception concerning leather. The animal’s skin is the most economically important coproduct of the meatpacking industry.
When dairy cows’ production declines, for example, their skin is made into leather; the hides of their offspring, “veal” calves, are made into high-priced calfskin. Thus, the economic success of the slaughterhouse (and the factory farm) is directly linked to the sale of leather goods. Decreasing demand for both animal foods and leather products will result in fewer cows being factory-farmed and killed. There are so many alternatives to leather, why support unnecessary cruelty?
"
208,Can children learn physiology without dissection?,"Fourteen published studies prove that students who use alternatives learn as well as, and often better than, those who dissect animals. In this day and age, there’s just no need to cut up animals to learn about life. Dissection isn’t even mandatory for students who wish to pursue studies in health-related fields: Doctors, surgeons, and veterinarians can all become practicing professionals without harming a single animal. Instead, with modern and humane teaching methods, instructors can teach science and ethics simultaneously. To learn more, please click here.
"
209,What do you mean by “animal rights”?,"Animal rights means that animals deserve certain kinds of consideration—consideration of what is in their best interests, regardless of whether they are “cute,” useful to humans, or an endangered species and regardless of whether any human cares about them at all. It means recognizing that animals are not ours to use—for food, clothing, entertainment, or experimentation.
"
210,Is there a humane way to get rid of mice and rats?,"There’s a humane way to do anything! According to Dr. David E. Davis of Johns Hopkins University, “Poisons or traps merely make space for more rats to grow.” To prevent a rat or mouse problem, take away what makes your home attractive to them: food and shelter. Start by making sure that there is no food in open places or in cardboard containers, which rats can eat right through. Keep garbage in tightly covered containers. Next, deny them a way to enter your home by sealing holes at the bottom of walls. Of course, this means that while no rats can come in, any who are already inside can’t get out. If rats are already inside, you will need to set a trap—but be careful which one you pick. Glue traps, flat boxes with adhesive to trap rodents, should be avoided at all costs. Some animals caught in these sticky contraptions break or even bite off their own legs to get free, and the glue badly irritates and scars their eyes. Animals whose faces become stuck in the glue slowly suffocate, and all trapped animals are subject to starvation and dehydration. Nonlethal traps are widely available, inexpensive, and easy to use. Sold by most humane societies and hardware stores, the box-like plastic or metal trap has a spring-release door that closes behind the animal once he or she enters the trap. Check the trap daily, and if you find an animal, simply release him or her outside.
"
211,Has animal experimentation advanced our knowledge of cancer?,"The New England Journal of Medicine has declared that 20 years of fighting cancer have been unsuccessful in significantly reducing the death rates from the disease. Despite a two-decade-long war on the disease, cancer remains our number two killer. Those who line their pockets with animals’ suffering are full of dire predictions that medical research will screech to a halt if we stop experimenting on animals. But animal experiments hurt humans as well as the animals who are burned, shocked, starved, cut open, and killed. While people and animals suffer alike, physiologically, different species vary so vastly that data can’t be accurately extrapolated from one species to another. Even chimpanzees, our closest living relatives—with whom we share 99 percent of our DNA—don’t sicken when infected with many diseases that are fatal to us.
Alternatives to animal tests are efficient and reliable and, in most cases, take less time to complete, cost only a fraction of the animal experiments they replace, and are not plagued with species differences that make extrapolation difficult or impossible. Today’s most forward-thinking scientists realize that we don’t need to choose between human health and compassion for animals.
"
212,Is it OK to declaw cats?,"If you asked your cat if it would be okay to put her through 10 separate, painful amputations that would weaken her legs, shoulders, and back muscles, she would probably say “no”—and she wouldn’t be alone. Many veterinarians in the U.S. and abroad absolutely refuse to declaw cats. In fact, in Germany and some other parts of Europe, declawing is illegal. Cats who have been declawed experience extreme pain when coming out of anesthesia and have difficulty walking until their paws heal. Without their claws, cats are virtually defenseless, and this can lead to neurosis and even skin and bladder problems.
Cats can easily be taught not to scratch furniture with the aid of a scratching post and firm, consistent instructions on where they may and may not scratch. To learn more, please visit  PETA’s declawing factsheet.
"
213,I have heard that ketchup contains animal blood and/or other animal-derived ingredients. Is this true?,"We have never encountered information that indicates that ketchup contains blood or any other animal-derived ingredient. It is possible that the “natural flavors” in the list of ingredients could be animal-derived. Contact the manufacturer of the brand that you are interested in to inquire about the source of the natural flavors. Organic ketchups are likely to be free of additives that may contain animal-derived products.
According to the Heinz Web site (under “Heinz Products”) “Heinz ketchup has never contained any animal products.” The site goes on to say that “the FDA has set a standard of identity for ketchup that does not permit the use of any animal products. Any deviation from this standard of identity would mean that the product could no longer be called ketchup [or be] sold legally under the name ketchup.”
"
214,"If everyone switches to vegetables and grains, will there be enough to eat?","Yes. We feed so much grain to animals in order to fatten them up for consumption that if we all became vegetarians, we could produce enough food to feed the entire world. In the U.S., animals are fed more than 80 percent of the corn we grow and more than 95 percent of the oats. The world’s cattle alone consume a quantity of food equal to the caloric needs of 8.7 billion people—more than the entire human population on Earth. Click here for more on meat and the environment.
"
215,What are some alternatives to eggs?,"Often, one egg in a recipe can simply be skipped, but there are also many tried and true substitutes that work wonders:
Crumbled and seasoned tofu makes delicious morning scrambles and eggless salad. Also, look for eggless mayonnaise, scrambled-tofu mixes, and other egg alternatives in your local health food store. Be aware that Egg Beaters, sold in many supermarkets, are made with egg whites, meaning that twice as many eggs are used in their production since the yolks are discarded.
Instead of using an egg for binding burgers and loaves, try mashed potato, mashed avocado, moistened bread crumbs, or rolled oats. For baking, try the following (each substitute replaces one egg):
Commercial egg replacer (this is a powder sold in boxes at most health food stores) 3 Tbsp. silken tofu blended with the liquid in the recipe2 Tbsp. cornstarch, potato starch, or arrowroot mixed with 2 Tbsp. water 1 heaping Tbsp. soy flour + 2 Tbsp. water 1/2 banana, mashed 1 Tbsp. flax seeds + 1/2 cup water blended for 1 to 2 minutes or until the mixture is thick and has the consistency of beaten egg whites
"
216,Animals are not as intelligent or advanced as humans.,"
If having superior intelligence does not entitle one human to abuse another human for his or her purposes, why should it entitle humans to abuse nonhumans?
There are animals who are unquestionably more intelligent, creative, aware, communicative, and able to use language than some humans, as in the case of a chimpanzee compared to a human infant or a person with a severe developmental disability, for example. Should the more intelligent animals have rights and the less intelligent humans be denied rights? Nineteenth-century philosopher Jeremy Bentham wrote, “The question is not, can they reason? Nor, can they talk? But can they suffer?” The measure of who deserves protection is not intelligence, it is the capacity to feel pain.
"
217,How is a company certified as cruelty-free?,"Companies listed either signed PETA’s statement of assurance or provided a statement verifying that they do not conduct or commission any animal tests on ingredients, formulations, or finished products and that they pledge not to do so in the future.

218,I recently became a vegetarian and will no longer buy leather. Does that mean I should get rid of all the leather products that I already own?,"This is a tough question because, on the one hand, you don’t want to send a silent message that these products are acceptable by wearing them. On the other hand, not all of us have the luxury of being able to throw out lots of our old clothes in order to buy an entirely new (cruelty-free) wardrobe! If you can do so, we recommend throwing the shoes away or donating them to PETA (for use in protests) and replacing them with leather-free products. If it is impossible for you to buy nonleather shoes right now, explain to people that while you refuse to finance the meat and leather industries with any further purchases, the money that paid for the leather on your feet is already spent, and when those leather shoes wear out, you’ll replace them with ones made from non-animal materials.

"
219,What is the difference between “animal rights” and “animal welfare”?,"
Animal welfare theories accept that animals have interests but allow these interests to be traded away as long as there are some human benefits that are thought to justify that sacrifice.
Animal rights means that animals, like humans, have interests that cannot be sacrificed or traded away just because it might benefit others. However, the rights position does not hold that rights are absolute; an animal’s rights, just like those of humans, must be limited, and rights can certainly conflict. Animal rights means that animals are not ours to use for food, clothing, entertainment, or experimentation. Animal welfare allows these uses as long as “humane” guidelines are followed.
"
220,Is the fur industry really as cruel as people make it out to be?,"Crueler. PETA’s investigations at fur farms have found animals being killed by anal electrocution—an electrically charged steel rod is inserted into the animals’ rectums, literally frying their insides. Exposed broken bones, upper respiratory infections, and cancerous tumors were among the wounds and diseases that animals endured—without veterinary treatment—on one fur farm that we investigated.
Animals caught in steel-jaw traps are in so much pain that some actually bite off their limbs in order to escape. Unable to eat, keep warm, or defend themselves against predators, many die horrible deaths before the trapper arrives to kill them. Others suffer in the traps for days until they are caught and killed. To avoid damaging the pelt, trappers often beat or stomp the animals to death. Most states have no regulations regarding methods of slaughtering these animals.
Whether enduring the excruciating pain of a steel-jaw traps or a lifetime of agony in a tiny cage, the animals suffer immensely. To learn more, see PETA’s factsheets on trapping, and on fur factory farms.
"
221,Hunting fees are a major source of revenue for wildlife management and habitat restoration.,"The relatively small fee each hunter pays does not cover the cost of hunting programs or game warden salaries. Hunting fees pay for hunter programs that benefit only hunters, like manipulating animal populations to increase the number of animals available to kill. The public lands that many hunters use are supported by taxpayers, and funds benefiting “nongame” species are scarce.
"
222,What is the most humane way to cook lobsters—boiling them or steaming them in the microwave?,"None of the above!
Contrary to claims made by seafood sellers, lobsters do feel pain, and they suffer immensely when they are cut, broiled, or boiled alive.
Most scientists agree that a lobster’s nervous system is quite sophisticated. For example, neurobiologist Tom Abrams says lobsters have “a full array of senses.” Jelle Atema, a marine biologist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., and one of the country’s leading experts on lobsters, says, “I personally believe they do feel pain.”
Lobsters may even feel more pain than we would in similar situations. One popular food magazine recently suggested cutting live lobsters in half before tossing them on the grill (a recipe that’s “not for the squeamish,” the magazine warned), and more than one chef has been known to slice and dice lobsters before cooking them. But, says invertebrate zoologist Jaren G. Horsley, “The lobster does not have an autonomic nervous system that puts it into a state of shock when it is harmed. It probably feels itself being cut. … I think the lobster is in a great deal of pain from being cut open … [and] feels all the pain until its nervous system is destroyed” during cooking.
Don’t heat up the water just yet, though. Anyone who has ever boiled a lobster alive can attest that, when dropped into scalding water, lobsters whip their bodies wildly and scrape the sides of the pot in a desperate attempt to escape. In the journal Science, researcher Gordon Gunter described this method of killing lobsters as “unnecessary torture.”
In fact, after looking at a dozen methods commonly used to kill and cook lobsters, Massachusetts’ Coalition to End Animal Suffering and Exploitation concluded that none “provides a reliably quick or painless death” or can be “considered humane or even relatively humane.”
We would never subject dogs or cats to such cruel treatment—why should it be any different for lobsters? If you’re ready to liberate lobsters—and other animals—from your plate, request a free copy of PETA’s vegetarian starter kit.

223,What’s wrong with beeswax?,"Beeswax, found in some lipsticks and other cosmetics, is obtained by melting a honeycomb with boiling water and then straining and cooling it.
It is not unusual for farmers at larger bee farms to cut off the queen bee’s wings so that she cannot leave the colony or to have her artificially inseminated on a bee-sized version of the factory-farm “rape rack.” When the beekeeper wants to move a queen to a new colony, she is carried with “bodyguard” bees, all of whom—if they survive transport—will be killed by the bees in the new colony. Large commercial bee farms may also replace the honey—which bees produce and need to get through the winter—with a cheap sugar substitute that lacks the nutrition of honey.
Many bees are killed or have their wings and legs torn off because of haphazard handling.

"
224,What rights should animals have?,"
Animals have the right to equal consideration of their interests. For instance, a dog most certainly has an interest in not having pain inflicted on him or her unnecessarily. We therefore are obliged to take that interest into consideration and to respect the dog’s right not to have pain unnecessarily inflicted upon him or her. However, animals don’t always have the same rights as humans, because their interests are not always the same as ours and some rights would be irrelevant to animals’ lives. For instance, a dog doesn’t have an interest in voting and therefore doesn’t have the right to vote, since that right would be as meaningless to a dog as it is to a child.
"
225,What’s wrong with silk?,"Silk is the fiber that silkworms weave to make cocoons. To obtain silk, distributors boil the worms alive inside their cocoons. Anyone who has ever seen worms startle when their dark homes are uncovered must acknowledge that worms are sensate—they produce endorphins and have a physical response to pain. 
Humane alternatives to silk—including nylon, milkweed seed pod fibers, silk-cotton tree and ceiba tree filaments, polyester, and rayon—are easy to find and usually less expensive, too. Click here to read PETA’s “Down and Silk: Birds and Insects Exploited for Fabric” factsheet.
"
226,But don’t cows need to be milked?,"Cows—like all mammals—need to become pregnant in order to produce milk. “Dairy” cows are impregnated every year so that they will produce a steady supply of milk. Whereas in nature, the baby drinks the milk that the mother produces, humans take the calf away from the mother cow and drink the milk intended for her baby. Cows wouldn’t need to be milked if we didn’t take their calves away from them or impregnate them in the first place. 
"
227,How do circuses train animals?,"Joel Parrott, executive director of the Oakland Zoo, testified before Congress that training “can be severe, using techniques that include prolonged hitting by the elephant trainer with clubs, stabbing with the point of the ankus, pitchforks, electricity, electric prods, prolonged chaining, and food deprivation.”
Tigers and lions spend most of their lives in cramped transport cages, barely able to take a step in any direction. They learn to fear the whip and often cringe and cower as trainers approach. Elephant babies, ripped from their mothers’ sides, perform under threat of punishment night after night, eyes always riveted on the person with the metal hook or the whip.
Circuses that exploit animals have no place in a compassionate society. It’s time for all of us to stop patronizing animal circuses—and to demand that the animal performers be sent to sanctuaries, where they can live out their lives in dignity. For more information, please click here.

228,What inspired your “Got Prostate Cancer?” Campaign?,"Our ad was intended to call attention to the link between milk consumption and prostate cancer and to encourage others to take steps to minimize their risk of the disease.
Scientists now believe that milk consumption is a major risk factor for prostate cancer. According to the World Cancer Research Fund, 11 separate human population studies have tied dairy consumption to prostate cancer. Results of the landmark Physicians’ Health Study of 20,885 doctors showed that men who consumed at least 2 1/2 servings of dairy “products” (about a bowl of ice cream) daily were about 30 percent more likely to develop prostate cancer than men who averaged less than half a serving a day. The Health Professionals Follow-Up Study found that men who consumed high amounts of dairy products had a 70 percent increased risk of prostate cancer.
Because PETA doesn’t have the multimillion-dollar advertising budget of the dairy industry, we have to rely on attention-grabbing means to get the word out. Putting a public figure like Mayor Giuliani (who has spoken very publicly about his cancer and has promoted dairy on television) on a billboard drew more attention to the issue than an anonymous face ever would have. The widespread media interest in the ad—including coverage by The Today Show, MSNBC, CNN, Fox National News, and every major U.S. newspaper, as well as more than 50 radio interviews—allowed us to tell people about the downside of dairy, something that, until then, many people had heard little about.
Many of us here at PETA have lost loved ones to cancer; in fact, PETA president Ingrid Newkirk’s father had prostate cancer when he died. We wish someone had warned them how many cancer deaths are linked to diet—two-thirds, according to the U.S. surgeon general—back before they started on the nutritional paths that ultimately took their lives. Mayor Giuliani’s illness has a chance of alerting others and becoming a life-saving experience. After all, 180,000 more men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, and more than 30,000 of them will die from it. They and their families deserve to have the facts.

229,I heard that some vegetarians sued McDonald’s for using beef flavoring in its French fries. Who won?,"McDonald’s got into hot water with vegetarians when it advertised that its fries were cooked in vegetable oil, but didn’t readily disclose that the fries were flavored with beef tallow.
McDonald’s was sued by several vegetarians and Hindus who do not eat meat for ethical and/or religious reasons. McDonald’s agreed to issue an apology and pay $10 million to vegetarian and religious groups. While the French fries still contain beef flavoring at this time, we’re hopeful that the lawsuit will help persuade McDonald’s to remove it.
The Vegetarian Resource Group has a list of the vegetarian and vegan items that are available at most popular fast-food restaurants. Click here, for more information.
PETA encourages everyone to request vegetarian items at fast-food restaurants. Burger King has responded to consumer demand by offering a vegetarian burger, the BK Veggie.

230,"With animal exploitation so widespread in our society, I sometimes get discouraged. Do you have any words of advice?","While it’s easy to get frustrated, the animals are counting on us to keep fighting for them. Edmund Burke said, “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” Thanks to the actions of “good people,” animals’ lives are being saved every day.
Victories occur constantly all over the world. Millions of people have decided to stop wearing and buying fur as a result of attention-grabbing campaigns and have consequently sent the fur industry into a nose-dive.
One million people go vegetarian every year after learning from people like you about how animals suffer in the meat industry. Millions of consumers have sworn never to buy from companies that cruelly test their products on animals, causing more than 500 companies to swear off animal tests. Please see PETA’s annual review to read about groundbreaking advances for animals made in the past year.

Whereas letters from a national organization are sometimes perceived as an interest group “just doing its job,” letters from readers and listeners in the community can be much more effective.

235,Is it all right to buy my new puppy from a pet store?,"Many dogs sold in pet shops come from puppy mills and breeding kennels found mostly in the Midwest. In puppy mills, female dogs are kept in crude, outdoor cages without protection from rain, sweltering heat, bitter cold, and biting wind. Denied companionship and comfort, they are treated like breeding machines. Their puppies are taken from them at an early age, packed into crates, and shipped hundreds of miles to dealers, often without adequate food, water, or ventilation. Poor breeding practices lead to numerous health problems, including distemper, parvovirus, respiratory conditions, physical deformities, deafness, eye diseases, and a host of other ailments.
Once the puppies get to the pet store, life in cramped cages adds more strain to their already stressed lives, increasing their susceptibility to disease. No law regulates how pet shops dispose of their animals, and some stores have been caught killing unsold dogs on the premises and throwing them into trash Dumpsters. Breeders churn out countless numbers of puppies each year, while millions of dogs are killed for want of a good home. Dogs are dumped at local pounds or abandoned in the woods and on city streets. Animal shelters can place only a fraction of the animals they receive, and the rest must be put to death. Because of this overpopulation crisis, no breeding can be considered “responsible.”
If you have the time, energy, space, and money to care for a dog (or two), please visit your local animal shelter and adopt.

236,Why do vegans use controversial tactics?,"PETA’s mission is to get the animal rights message out to as many people as possible. Unlike our opposition—which is mostly composed of wealthy industries and corporations—PETA must rely largely on free “advertising” through media coverage. We will do extraordinary things to get the word out about animal cruelty because we have learned from experience that the media, sadly, do not consider the terrible facts about animal suffering alone interesting enough to cover. It is sometimes necessary to shake people up in order to initiate discussion, debate, questioning of the status quo, and, of course, action.
Thus, we try to make our actions colorful and controversial, thereby grabbing headlines around the world and spreading the message of kindness to animals to thousands—sometimes millions—of people. This approach has proved amazingly successful: In the three decades since PETA was founded, it has grown into the largest animal rights group in the country, with more than 6.5 million members and supporters worldwide. We have also had major groundbreaking successes, such as bringing about the first-ever cruelty conviction against an animal experimenter in the case of the now-famous Silver Spring Monkeys; orchestrating the first-ever raid on an agricultural facility (a factory farm in upstate New York that raised ducks for foie gras under horribly cruel conditions); and convincing more than 200 cosmetics companies to permanently abandon animal tests.
"
237,Why do vegans sometimes use nudity in its campaigns?,"PETA believes that women—and men—should be able to use their own bodies as political statements. Like Lady Godiva, who rode naked on a horse to protest taxes on the poor in the 11th century, PETA knows that provocative, attention-grabbing actions are sometimes necessary to get people talking about issues that they would otherwise prefer not to think about.
The smart, compassionate men and women who pose “naked” for PETA choose to do so because they support the cause and want to take action to help animals. For example, model Rosanna Davison, who has a degree in biomedicine and naturopathic nutrition, chose to pose naked for PETA’s “Vegans Are Red Hot” advertisement because her body has benefited from wholesome plant-based foods and she wanted to promote healthy vegan living. If you take a moment to read her commentary “Why I posed naked for a cause I believe in,” you may better understand why she was so eager to call attention to the issue.
Many famous men, including football player Bret Lockett, actor Steve-O, rapper Waka Flocka Flame, and goalkeeper Tim Howard, have stripped down to make a difference for animals as well. Thanks to them, countless people visited our website to learn more about the issues and find out what they can do to help animals.
All of PETA’s “naked” advertisements are intended to underscore an important message, whether it’s to reveal the cruelty of fur production, to emphasize the health benefits of vegan foods, or to show the vulnerability of animals in laboratories or circuses. If you want to learn more about these issues, please visit the Issues page on PETA’s website.

240,Is commercial fishing bad for the environment?,"Many commercial fishing vessels practice bottom-trawling in order to catch sea animals who live near, on, or under the sea floor, such as flounder, cod, grouper, shrimp, and scallops. Scientists say that the destruction caused by bottom-trawling is similar to that caused by clear-cutting old forests, only on a far greater scale. For example, the area of seabed trawled each year is roughly the size of the 48 contiguous states: 150 times greater than the area of forest cut! Elliot Norse, president of the Marine Conservation Biology Institute, says, “Scientists find that bottom-trawling is the largest disturbance to the world’s sea floor and possibly the largest human-caused disturbance to the biosphere.”

Legality is no guarantee of morality. Who does and doesn’t have legal rights is determined merely by the opinion of current legislators.

243,Is hunting necessary to stop overpopulation of deer and other animals?,"No. Starvation and disease are unfortunate, but they are nature’s way of ensuring that the strong survive. Natural predators help keep prey species strong by killing the only ones they can catch—the sick and weak. Hunters, however, kill any animal they come across or any animal whose head they think would look good mounted above the fireplace—often the large, healthy animals needed to keep the population strong. And hunting creates the ideal conditions for overpopulation. After hunting season, the abrupt drop in population leads to less competition among survivors, resulting in a higher birth rate. If we were really concerned about keeping animals from starving, we would not hunt but instead take steps to reduce the animals’ fertility. We would also preserve wolves, mountain lions, coyotes, and other natural predators. Ironically, many deer herds and duck populations are purposely manipulated to produce more and more animals for hunters to kill.

244,Is it true that some companies actually use dog and cat fur in their products?,"Unfortunately, yes. Dogs and cats are killed for their skin in Asia, just as bobcats and foxes are killed in the United States. Their skin is turned into items such as fur coats, fur figurines, and leather shoes and sold in America to unsuspecting consumers.

245,What’s the reasoning behind the “Tax Meat” Campaign?,"PETA is advocating an excise tax on each purchase of meat in the same way that cancer-awareness groups advocated taxing cigarettes. Reports estimate that Americans spend as much as $123 billion a year to treat hypertension, heart disease, stroke, cancer, obesity, and other diseases directly related to meat consumption. PETA wants a meat tax to pay for dietary education programs that would help reduce health care costs and save consumers’ and animals’ lives.
In addition, a tax on meat would help pay for the meat industry’s huge detrimental effect on the environment. Environmental groups like the National Audubon Society and the Union of Concerned Scientists are recognizing that meat-eating is one of the worst things we do to the planet.

246,What can I do to help put a stop to the cruelty in the fur industry?,"You can help by speaking with the managers of any stores selling fur and fur trim and letting them know that you won’t be shopping there until they get fur off the racks. Set up an information table outside a store selling fur or on a busy street. We can send you posters and leaflets to use. Let fur-wearers know how you feel about animal cruelty, and have leaflets on hand to educate them about it.
PETA also has anti-fur buttons available that you can use to adorn your cruelty-free bag or nonfur coat. Writing letters to the editors of your local newspapers about the cruelty of fur can affect countless people.
There’s also a wonderful, upbeat video called The Witness (available at www.TribeofHeart.org), a very effective and moving educational tool on the subject of fur, that you can show friends or have shown at a local library, college, or church.
"
247,Don’t existing laws ensure that animals in labs are treated humanely?,"No. There are no regulations that govern the conduct of an experiment, limits what animals are forced to endure, or prevents the duplication of painful experiments. Animals are routinely infected with diseases they would never normally contract, cut open, burned, starved, driven insane, poisoned, and killed—and it’s all legal. The March of Dimes, a charity that funds animal studies, has paid experimenters to sew cats’ eyes shut for a year and then kill them; keep monkeys in restraints for days at a time; give ferrets and other animals severe brain damage; and addict rats and newborn opossums to alcohol, nicotine, and cocaine. The only federal law that offers any sort of protection for animals in laboratories, the Animal Welfare Act, deals primarily with housekeeping issues, such as cage size.
Even when cages are clean, animals in laboratories are still deprived of everything that makes life worthwhile—the companionship of others of their own kind, fresh air, freedom to run or climb, and the ability to make even the simplest choices about their lives. After months, years, and sometimes decades of being poked and prodded, they die or are killed—hardly an ethical way of treating another sentient being.
To learn more about the lives of these animals, see PETA’s factsheets on Animal Experimentation.

248,At least the animals on factory farms are fed and protected.,"
This argument was used to claim that black people were better off as slaves on plantations than as free men and women. The same could also be said of people in prison, yet prison is considered one of society’s harshest punishments. Animals on factory farms suffer so much that it is inconceivable that they could be worse off in the wild. The wild isn’t “wild” to the animals who live there; it’s their home. There they have their freedom and can engage in their natural activities. The fact that they might suffer in the wild is no reason to ensure that they suffer in captivity.
"
249,Won’t reducing intensive meat production be sufficient to improve the environment?,"Plainly put, the sheer quantity of animals required to feed people’s taste for meat, dairy products, and eggs makes humane, environmentally responsible practices impossible. Profitability dictates that the meat, dairy, and egg industries crowd the largest number of animals into the smallest space possible, leading to massive water pollution, soil erosion from the amount of crops needed to feed these animals, and other eco-nightmares.

250,"There are mice living in my basement. I don’t want them there, but all I can find at the store are glue traps, poison, and mousetraps. Do I have any other options?","Minus a neighborhood Pied Piper, what’s a squeamish homeowner to do? First of all, don’t even think about using mousetraps, poison, or glue traps. Studies have shown that some animals caught in glue traps break or even bite off their own legs in an effort to escape, and the glue badly irritates and scars their eyes. Animals whose faces become stuck in the glue slowly suffocate, and all trapped animals are subject to starvation and dehydration. Glue traps are also dangerous to dogs and cats. For more information, please read PETA’s “Glue Traps: Pans of Pain” factsheet.
If you see glue traps at a store, complain to the manager! Ask them to only carry humane traps (available at PETACatalog.org).
Nonlethal traps are widely available, inexpensive, and easy to use. Sold in hardware stores, as well as in PETA’s catalog, they consist of a boxlike plastic or metal trap with a springrelease door that closes behind the animal once he or she enters the trap. Check the trap every hour, and if you find an animal, simply release him or her in a suitable location outside.
You also must make your home less attractive to mice. Start by doing a thorough sweep of your house. Make sure there is no food left in open places or in cardboard containers, which mice can eat right through. Keep garbage in tightly covered containers. Remove mice shelters by keeping storage spaces orderly and keeping stored items off the floor.
Next, deny mice a way to enter your home by sealing holes around the bottom of walls—even small ones, since a mouse can wriggle through a hole no larger than a quarter. Seal holes in exterior walls, as well.
With a little bit of effort, you can live mousefree without cruelty!

251,Why do vegans believe that pro-life activists should be vegan?,"When people say that they are “pro-life” yet choose to support violence, misery, and death every time they eat a meal, they have become “pro-death.” The obvious “pro-life” choice is to be vegan.
Every time we sit down to eat, we make a life or death choice: Do we want to support compassion and mercy? Or do we want to support misery, violence, and bloodshed? Will we opt to be cruel or to be kind? Most of us would agree that it is immoral to cause gratuitous suffering to a dog or a cat. It makes sense to extend this same understanding to equally sensitive cows, pigs, chickens, fish, and other animals.

252,"My biggest problem with commercial fishing is all the unintended animals who are caught, killed, and thrown away. That’s not an issue when fish are aquafarmed, though, is it?","Fish-eating birds are drawn to open aquaculture ponds as a source of food. Rather than using nonlethal measures to keep birds from eating the fish, such as netting the ponds, many aquafarmers simply kill the birds. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS), which issues the permits allowing the birds to be killed, has no method in place to ensure that aquafarmers obey the permit limits for numbers and species of birds killed.
When the National Audubon Society investigated aquaculture sites, they found massive burial pits of dead birds—far more than USFWS permits allowed. Nevertheless, distinguishing between intended and unintended victims is arbitrary; animas don’t suffer any less because they get eaten.

253,How can you justify spending your time helping animals when so many humans need help?,"There are many serious problems in our world that deserve our attention; cruelty to animals is one of them.
No one organization can fight all moral and social crimes; for example, the American Heart Association fights heart disease, but not cancer or any other disease. Save the Children helps starving children, but not disabled veterans. Fortunately, PETA’s pro-animal activities have great power to better the human condition as well. As vegetarians, we advocate eating lower on the food chain, which would not only save 25 billion innocent animals from slaughter each year, but would also save humans from a diet known to cause heart disease and cancer.
We can help feed starving children around the world by choosing carefully what we put on our plates. Adhering to a plant-based diet makes 16 times more food available for other hungry people than consuming a meat-eating diet. Eliminating intensive factory farming of animals would also save precious fresh water and topsoil.
Teaching respect for animals is also an important part of preventing violence to humans. George T. Angell said, “I am sometimes asked, ‘Why do you spend so much of your time and money talking about kindness to animals when there is so much cruelty to men?’ I answer: ‘I am working at the roots.’” Please see our factsheet on the link between violence toward humans and abuse of animals
"
254,"Why do some product labels say, “No animal ingredients,” when they contain beeswax, lanolin, buttermilk, etc.?","This type of misleading labeling is often caused by a lack of education about animal issues or by insensitivity to the suffering of animals in the production of products that do not involve the actual slaughter of the animal. PETA attempts to educate officials at these companies, but some have persisted in inaccurately labeling their products even though honey, lanolin, buttermilk, etc., are, indeed, animal products. We advise you to read the entire label before believing such a statement and to voice your complaints when you find products that are mislabeled.

"
255,"If I stop consuming dairy products, won’t that put me at greater risk for osteoporosis?","High-protein foods, such as meat, eggs, and dairy products, produce poisonous byproducts when they are broken down so the body buffers the toxins with calcium before they are eliminated. This leaches calcium from the body, including from the bones, resulting in a loss that cancels out the dietary intake of calcium from animal products. In countries where dairy products are not generally consumed, there is less osteoporosis than in the United States, where dairy consumption is among the highest in the world. The Harvard Nurses’ Health Study followed 78,000 women for 12 years and found that milk did not protect them against bone fractures. In fact, those who drank three glasses of milk per day had more fractures than those who rarely drank milk. To learn more, please visit PCRM.org.
Also, an excellent discussion of dietary links to osteoporosis can be found in Dr. John McDougall’s The McDougall Plan and in Dr. Neal Barnard’s The Power of Your Plate.

256,What do I do if I think my vet or groomer has harmed my animal?,"If you suspect your veterinarian of malpractice, you should make a complaint to your State Board of Examiners. While nothing will take away the stress and fear that your animal has gone through, our factsheet “Veterinary Malpractice and Grooming Accidents” outlines ways to prevent animals from suffering in the future.
Animals have been seriously injured or killed at grooming salons when they were left unattended in front of hot dryers. Other animals have been found hanging by their collars or leashes after being left alone in bathtubs or on grooming tables. Taking precautions is the best way to prevent accidents: We recommend learning to groom your animal at home or employing a groomer who makes house calls and operates under your watchful eye. However, if you do decide to leave your animal at a grooming salon, request references from other clients first.
If a groomer injures your animal, you can file a small claims suit or lawsuit against the groomer or salon. A story about your animal’s injuries on a local television station or in the newspaper can help prevent additional tragedies. For more information, you may wish to contact the Information Center for Grooming Accidents at 700 Vista Abajo N.E., Albuquerque, NM 87123; 505-293-7488.

257,People have always eaten animal products. Why should we stop now?,"Never in human history have people eaten as many animal products as we do now. Today, rich and poor can afford to eat these products, largely as a result of the cost-cutting methods used to raise “food” animals. Present-day factory farms inflict massive, large-scale suffering of a magnitude never before seen in agricultural practices. In addition, the human population is larger today than ever before. Billions of people eating meat means that billions of tons of water and grain are being diverted from the world’s poor people and fed to the livestock of the rich; the resultant billions of pounds of manure are destroying our topsoil, drinking water, and ozone layer. In addition, today we not only have medical evidence of the health benefits of a plant-based diet, we also have many easily accessible products, such as tofu, tempeh, nondairy milk, yogurt, cheese, and ice cream, and many other healthful and delicious products that make the switch to a vegan diet easy and delicious.

258,How can I help prevent “roadkill”?,"
Defensive driving techniques, such as driving slowly at night, honking your horn at animals who look as if they are about to enter the roadway, or flashing your high beams at animals to break the sometimes hypnotic effect of the glare of the headlights can help. Many people swear by “deer alarms,” small whistles inaudible to human ears that you attach to the front bumper of your car.

Carry an animal rescue kit in your car for stray or injured animals. It should include dog biscuits and cat food (to lure reluctant animals); a long rope or leash that can be looped into a collar to capture dogs and cats; a bandage for a muzzle (an injured dog may snap or bite); a collapsible cardboard cat carrier (for cats, squirrels, turtles, and other small animals); a blanket or towel; a brown paper bag and clothespin to keep it shut (for carrying injured birds), and a list of emergency phone numbers of veterinarians, humane societies, animal shelters, and wildlife rehabilitators.

If you come upon an animal who has been killed by a car, you can either move him or her out of the roadway yourself, or report the incident to the local animal control department who will usually come and pick up the animal.

260,Why do vegans include companies in the cruelty-free company section that utilise animal-derived ingredients or byproducts?,"PETA uses the term “cruelty-free” to denote companies that do not test their products on animals. The purpose of our Caring Consumer Project is to persuade companies that produce cosmetics and household products to stop testing on animals. If companies stop conducting animal tests, they meet the criteria of this campaign and qualify for inclusion on our list of companies that do not test on animals. While nonvegan companies that do not conduct animal tests are, of course, not 100 percent cruelty-free in the fullest sense of the word, they have taken a significant step toward eliminating animal suffering by changing to a policy that does not include animal testing. We feel that it is important to recognize the meaningful steps that any individual or company takes to help animals. Furthermore, most consumers are not vegan, and many are only interested in putting an end to the cruelty involved in cosmetics testing. 
We would prefer that consumers buy products that are not tested on animals rather than products that are tested on animals, regardless of the type of ingredients. However, we would also prefer that consumers purchase vegan products rather than nonvegan products. Therefore, PETA’s cruelty-free lists clearly indicate which companies offer product lines that are entirely vegan, and we hope that our reference to this issue will encourage readers to consider the cruelty involved in animal ingredients and, ultimately, help them to take their compassion a step further.

261,How are racehorses usually treated?,"Sadly, for many equine athletes, injury and death are always just a hoofbeat away. A 1993 University of Minnesota study revealed that 840 horses were fatally injured on U.S. tracks in 1992, and 3,566 horses were injured so badly that they could not finish the race. Selective breeding over centuries has made thoroughbreds’ legs far too fragile for their bodies. Most thoroughbreds are owned by corporations that have no interest in them aside from making money; such owners don’t hesitate to sell horses to a slaughterhouse “kill buyer” when they break down. First, though, many horses are turned into junkies by their trainers and veterinarians, who provide drugs to keep them racing when they shouldn’t be on the track. Dr. Gregory Ferraro, a former racetrack veterinarian, says that treatments are now often used “to force the animal, like some punch-drunk fighter, to make just one more round.” Horses are forced to run with hairline fractures that would be too painful to run on without drugs.
As an article in Sports Illustrated concluded: “There is much uncertainty about why so many racehorses end up dead on American tracks every year, but the figures are appalling and unacceptable by any humane standard.” To learn more, please read the factsheet about the horse-racing industry

262,Do musical instruments utilize animal products?,"Today, very few instruments are made with animal products. Gut strings are the only animal-derived product still commonly used in the creation of musical instruments.
However, even gut strings—most commonly found on very expensive tennis rackets, guitars, violins, and other stringed instruments—can easily be replaced with synthetics like nylon or steel. Almost any music store should be able to accommodate your request for a cruelty-free instrument. Before making a purchase, take the time to verify that the instrument is free of animal products by using the following information as a guide.
Animal Oils, Tallow Some companies advocate the use of lanolin, tallow, or other animal oils to clean drum heads. Vegetable-based oils can easily be used for this purpose.
Animal Skins In the past, animal skins from sheep, elks, and cows were commonly used to make drumheads and traditional bagpipes. Today, most drumheads are made from synthetic materials, and the creators of Gore-tex have developed a synthetic material for use in bagpipes.
Horsehair Violin bows may be made with horsehair, but synthetic vegan options exist.
Piano Keys Piano keys are rarely made from ivory but can be made from the hooves, horns, and bones of a variety of animals. Today, however, many piano makers—including Steinway and Baldwin—use white plastic.
Strings (Catgut) No one is sure of the origin of the term “catgut string,” but it is doubtful that the intestines of cats were ever used to make strings for instruments or rackets, since cats are widely considered to be too small for such uses. One theory is that the term originated from “kit,” a small fiddle-like instrument that used lamb gut strings. Others believe that the term grew out of the demand for strings made in Catagniny, Germany. These strings are derived from the same source as natural gut (see below).
Strings (Natural Gut) The raw material used in natural gut strings is a byproduct of the meat industry. It can come from several animals, including sheep, cattle, kangaroo, and water buffalo. Most gut strings are constructed out of serosa, the outermost layer of the intestines of cattle. However, the first major natural gut strings were made from the mucosa, the innermost layer of the intestine of sheep and lamb. The ability of the lining of the intestine to expand while eating and shrink after digestion is what makes natural gut so desirable to string manufacturers.
"
263,Is aquaculture bad for the environment?,"Fish farms, or “aquafarms,” discharge waste, pesticides, and other chemicals directly into ecologically fragile coastal waters, destroying local ecosystems. And aquaculture farms that raise fish directly in fenced-in areas of natural waters kill off thriving natural habitats by overloading them far beyond their capacity. Waste from the excessive number of fish can cause huge blankets of green slime on the water’s surface, depleting oxygen and killing much of the life in the water. In Brazil, destruction caused by aquaculture changed the local climate so much that some aquaculture operations have been forced to shut down.
Raising 1 ton of fish takes 8 tons of water. Intensive shrimp production takes up to 10 times more water. According to the journal Science, a 2-acre salmon farm produces as much waste as a town of 10,000 people. Salmon farms in British Columbia were found to be producing as much waste as a city of half a million people.
And while aquafarmers like to tout aquaculture as an alternative to depleting wild fish populations, many of the fish species they farm are predators, like salmon and shrimp, and are fed ocean fish. It takes 5 pounds of ocean fish to produce 1 pound of farmed fish.

"
265,What about fish in the wild caught by commercial fishers?,"Today’s commercial fishers use vast trawlers the size of football fields. These huge nets, sometimes miles long, stretch across the ocean, swallowing up everything in their path and killing countless animals in addition to those they are intended to catch. Factory trawlers are emptying the oceans of sea life at an alarming pace. Thirteen of the 17 major global fisheries are depleted or in serious decline. The other four are “overexploited” or “fully exploited.” I’ll never forget one fisher who operated a small fishing boat in Washington state. She said to me of an otter who had died in her net that day, “Anything stupid enough to get in my net deserves to die.” Nearly one-third of all species of fish have declined in population in the last 15 years, and many species may be wiped out in the next decade. The decline in fish populations is leading to increasing conflicts between fishers and the wildlife who eat fish. Some fishers intentionally kill or maim seals, birds, and marine mammals whom they perceive as a threat to their catch. Some species are in decline as a result of fishing. The number of Steller’s sea lions in the Bering Sea has declined by 80 percent since the 1950s. An estimated 100,000 seals, whales, and porpoises and a million birds every year become entangled in nets and drown. Because dolphins habitually swim with schools of tuna, the tuna fishing industry even today “accidentally” drowns at least 20,000 of these intelligent mammals annually. Critically endangered sea turtles have been killed incidentally by the thousands by shrimp trawlers. Eating one fish results in the deaths of many.

266,Vegan options are more expensive than their nonvegetarian counterparts. Can I afford to go vegan?,"You’re right that vegan specialty foods, like prepared veggie burgers, etc., are sometimes more expensive than their nonvegan counterparts, but fortunately, they aren’t the only options. Prepared food will always be more expensive than food you make yourself, so buying the ingredients and making them at home will typically save you money. Veggie staples such as pasta, rice, tofu, and beans are much cheaper than meat. The money you save from not buying meat can go toward paying just a little extra for nondairy milk and other staples, like fruits and vegetables. Another suggestion is to buy food in bulk, either at the store, over the Internet, or through catalogs. You can find many vegan mail-order catalogs listed in the classified section in the back of Vegetarian Times magazine.
In addition, consider your health: Fresh, organic fruits and vegetables may cost more than some junk foods, but isn’t your health worth the extra couple of bucks? If you’re still not sure, given the health benefits of a vegan diet, you’ll likely save hundreds or thousands of dollars on health care, which will more than make up for the extra cost of soy milk.

267,Eliminating all animal ingredients from the foods that I eat and the products that I use sounds challenging. What am I supposed to do?,
268,Do vegetarians have difficulty getting enough protein?,"In the West, our problem is that we get too much protein, not too little. Most Americans get about seven times as much protein as they need. You can get enough protein from whole wheat bread, oatmeal, beans, corn, peas, mushrooms, or broccoli—almost every food contains protein. Junk food aside, it’s almost impossible for vegans to eat as many calories as we need for good health without getting enough protein.
By contrast, too much protein is the major cause of osteoporosis and contributes to kidney failure and other diseases of affluence. Learn more.

"
270,Can plants feel pain?,"The scientific community is just beginning to recognize plants’ advanced capabilities, and we now know that they experience a variety of sensations. They can close or open up to avoid an attack or to await rain, for instance. Studies show that plants can feel a touch as light as a caterpillar’s footsteps and send out signals—similar to those sent by the human body—to warn their other leaves to release bad-tasting chemicals in order to deter damaging insects. Studies show that plants also communicate with one another; share medicinal compounds with other plants through their roots, an underground fungal network, and the air; release pheromones; see, hear, smell, and react to dangers in the environment via sensing proteins; pass knowledge on to younger plants; and more.
Just as at one time, many people did not realize that octopuses—whose nervous systems differ significantly from that of humans and other animals—are extremely intelligent and sensitive to pain, it’s possible that plants have intelligence and sentience that humans cannot yet detect. Perhaps one day, we will learn that they have ways of experiencing pain that we have yet to comprehend.
Whether or not that’s the case, there is no need to harm plants unnecessarily. While we must eat in order to survive, we can harm fewer plants by going vegan, because eating plants directly, rather than feeding them to animals and then killing those animals for their flesh, requires far fewer plants and hurts fewer animals who, we already know for sure, feel pain. Cows, for example, must consume 16 pounds of vegetation to yield 1 pound of flesh, so by being vegan, we save many more plants’ lives than if we ate meat. And of course, vegans also save nearly 200 animals every year—living, feeling beings who, scientists now know beyond a shadow of a doubt, experience the full range of sensations and emotions, including pain, discomfort, fear, and sadness.
Whether it can be proved that plants experience pain or not, vegan foods are the compassionate choice because they require the deaths of fewer plants and animals.
"
271,Don’t we need to eat meat and dairy products to be healthy?,"No! There is no nutritional need for humans to eat any animal products; all of our dietary needs, even as infants and children, are best supplied by an animal-free diet.
Cows’ milk is suited to the nutritional needs of calves, who, unlike human babies, will double their weight in 47 days (as opposed to 180 days for humans), grow four stomachs, and weigh 1,100-1,200 pounds within two years. Cow’s milk contains about three times as much protein as human milk and almost 50 percent more fat.
The consumption of animal products has been conclusively linked to heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and osteoporosis. Cholesterol (found only in animal products) and animal fat clog arteries, leading to heart attacks and strokes. The rate of many cancers—including colon, breast, cervical, uterine, ovarian, prostate, and lung—is highest in regions where meat consumption is high and lowest where meat-eating is uncommon. A study of more than 25,000 people found that vegetarians have a much lower risk of getting diabetes than meat-eaters. A South African study found not a single case of rheumatoid arthritis in a community of 800 people who ate no meat or dairy products.
There is no physical reason for humans to eat animal products. Cutting animal products from your diet is healthier for you, the animals, and the environment. Learn more about the health benefits of a plant-based diet at PCRM.org.

We can now test for skin irritancy on cells in a test tube, produce vaccines from human cell cultures, and perform pregnancy tests using blood samples instead of killing rabbits.

275,Are there wildlife organizations that I should be concerned about supporting?,"You may be unaware that some large “conservation” or “wildlife” organizations actually support hunting and trapping. Although their names and literature may suggest that they protect animals and/or habitats, they often regard animals as resources to be harvested or pests to be eliminated. U.S. hunters and trappers kill millions of animals every year and leave many others wounded and dying. Hunting disrupts natural wildlife populations and actually stimulates reproduction rates. Programs designed to preserve habitat or reduce the numbers of “overpopulated” animals are often funded by groups that wish to encourage excessive breeding to ensure a supply of “game” animals to hunt.
For more information about hunting, please read through PETA’s “Why Sport Hunting Is Cruel and Unnecessary” factsheet.
