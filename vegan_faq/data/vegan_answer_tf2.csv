0,Where do vegans get their protein? Do you get enough protein?,"Getting enough protein is not actually as hard as people will make you think. What people don’t realise is that protein is in virtually everything we eat! Plus most adults need only about 50g a day but consume considerably more than this.

Great vegan sources of protein include, tofu, tempeh, seitan, lentils, chickpeas, beans, nuts and seeds.

1,Are free range eggs bad?,"Most free range laying hens live in crowded sheds. Their outside area is generally restricted to a small enclosure with access via small exit holes which many hens are unable to reach and therefore have no outside access. The ones who do go outside are sometime trapped outside to be picked off by foxes. 

Hens can have a lifespan of 10 years, however they are often killed after 18 months when their productivity drops. Free range laying hens are the offspring of parent birds who are kept for their entire lives inside crowded, filthy sheds with no access to the outside. The hens and roosters are housed together for constant mating. 

The hens have no escape or respite from the roosters, their backs become featherless, red and sore from when roosters mount them. The female chicks of these parent birds are sent to free range, barn laid or caged sheds. The males are unwanted by-products and are killed soon after hatching, generally by being ground up alive in a macerator."
2,can vegans eat fish?,"I don’t want to state the obvious but… fish aren’t vegetables! Even though they are very different from us, they are still living and breathing sentient beings who experience suffering and pain, and they are not food."
3,Don't cows need to be milked though?,"A cow only needs to be milked because she had her calf taken away from her within a day or two of birth. The calf gets a cheap replacement formula generally made from slaughterhouse plasma and vitamins. Perhaps this strikes you as an unfair deal all the way around. And in a few months, after the cow’s milk yields peak, she’ll be re-impregnated once again to start the whole cycle all over. For more details, check out our page on dairy cows.

All in all, it’s a terrible life for these animals, especially the cows who live on “dry lot” dairies who are confined in crowded sheds. Disease is common, especially mastitis—an infection of the udders brought on by the enormous milk yields of modern-day dairy cows.

Luckily, it’s never been easier to go dairy-free. Excellent vegan versions of traditional dairy products are abundant and easy to find. Most groceries today carry soy, rice, and almond milk. And you can find excellent vegan cheese and ice cream at any natural foods store, and in better supermarkets. It’s also easy to find non-dairy yogurts, margarine, and even coffee creamer. Look for all these products in the dairy case."
4,Do animals suffer?,"Animals have the same evolutionary past as us and the same reporting mechanisms for pain that we do; a brain and central nervous system. They also produce the same reactions in scenarios where pain would arise; they flinch and make noises of distress. 

There’s strong evidence too that animals experience mental suffering. In stressful situations vertebrates have been found to release adrenally-derived glucocorticoid hormones which “drive gluconeogenesis, suppress reproductive processes, alter movement and feeding rates, impact immune functions, and generally help an individual enter a ‘state of emergency’ when an environmental stressor induces their release”. 

Fish too, for example, “experience a rise in cortisol” (commonly known as the stress hormone) when confronted with factors capable of producing fear. There is even evidence that animals can experience mental illnesses just as we do."
5,Do plants suffer?,"Plants have input and output reactions to certain stimulation, for example photosynthesis, but they can’t experience pain or mental suffering due to not having a brain or central nervous system. 

Being vegan actually reduces the number of plants eaten because the animals we eat have to be fed on vast quantities of plants. Producing a kilogram of beef requires 25 kilograms of grain, one kilogram of pork requires nine kilograms of grain and one kilogram of chicken requires three kilograms of grain. This is also why the argument that eating meat is better than being vegan because more insects and small animals are killed in plant agriculture does not hold."
6,"Does producing milk, cheese and eggs cause suffering?","These processes indeed cause great suffering to animals. Mother cows need to be pregnant to produce milk so from 15 months old they are forced into confined spaces every two or three months and artificially impregnated. 

After birth, the calf is removed from the mother within 36 hours; if the calf is male, he will likely be sold to be raised for veal or if there isn’t enough demand, he will be shot.  

Normally, a cow holds at most two litres of milk in her udder but the antibiotics farmers use for optimum milk production cause cows to carry 20 litres at any one time. The weight of this often makes cows lame or causes painful inflammation of the mammary glands (mastitis). 

Cows naturally live for up to 25 years but after 5 years of producing milk in these conditions their yield will no longer be profitable and they are slaughtered. 

In egg production, whether free range or not, hens have their beak painfully trimmed to prevent them injuring other hens due to the stress of confinement. 

They also experience a pre-mature death at around 80 weeks, when their natural life span is up to 8 years. Caged hens never see daylight and are restricted to space only slightly larger than a sheet of A4 paper. Male chicks are an unnecessary by-product of this process and are killed straight after hatching by incineration or gassing.   "
7,Does vegan food taste good?,"Yes it does! Our culture is all that limits us in eating an amazing selection of delicious vegan foods. We are increasingly programmed to eat highly processed and animal based diets. It is so much easier these days with plenty of vegan products and recipes available, and more coming into the market all the time"
8,Don’t we need some animal products in our diet to be healthy?,"For those who might be concerned about meeting all their nutritional requirements with just plant foods, rest assured that even the mainstream and conservative Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the American Dietetic Association, and described by www.eatright.org as “the world’s largest organization of food and nutrition professionals”) confirms that you do not need to eat animal products to maintain your health.

“It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life-cycle including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood and adolescence and for athletes.

Many people who become vegan report that their health greatly improves as a result. Perhaps, the lighter, healthier body that emerges with veganism is a reflection of a lighter, healthier conscience that comes with taking a stand against injustice and making a commitment to non-violence.

Finally, unlike the Atkins, Paleo, or South Beach diets, which are trendy fads, veganism is neither a fad nor a diet, but a stand against injustice and commitment to non-violence that impacts one’s eating choices because of ethical considerations. Nevertheless, the growing number of strong, active vegans are a testament to the fact that one doesn’t have to sacrifice one’s physical health to embrace a more gentle way of life."
9,What is environmental veganism?,"Environmental vegans focus on conservation, rejecting the use of animal products on the premise that fishing, hunting, trapping and farming, particularly factory farming, are environmentally unsustainable. This specific form of veganism focuses its way of living on how to have a sustainable way of life without consuming animals."
10,What is ethical veganism?,"Ethical veganism, also known as moral veganism, is based on opposition to speciesism, the assignment of value to individuals on the basis of (animal) species membership alone."
11,What is moral veganism?,"Ethical veganism, also known as moral veganism, is based on opposition to speciesism, the assignment of value to individuals on the basis of (animal) species membership alone."
12,We evolved to eat meat? It's natural,"There’s no doubt that at many times in history, especially during periods of war and famine, the ability for people to eat meat helped ensure their survival. Likewise, there are some parts of the world today where local populations depend of fish, poultry, or livestock for protein and calories. That’s because marginal lands that won’t support agriculture can often still support the grazing of livestock, and some coastal areas have insufficient land for farming but access to substantial amounts of fish.

That said, few people living in developed countries can credibly claim that their survival depends on animal products. In terms of nutrition, there’s nothing in animal products that isn’t readily available from a well-planned vegan diet.

And if we were really intent on feeding the world, we would stop feeding a huge portion of the worldwide grain crop to livestock (which entails massive food waste), and instead grow grains for human consumption."
13,How hard is it to really become a vegan?,"Nearly every single vegan you ask will tell you the transition was much easier than they expected. While becoming vegan may sound difficult right now, you’ll no doubt be shocked by how easy this is, especially if you take the time to read up on the topic."
14,Are vegan diets really good for the environment?,"Raising animals for meat, milk, and dairy production wastes resources and damages the environment on a massive scale. When fed to farm animals, a substantial portion of the calories and nutrients present in grains is turned to manure. This manure invariably pollutes local water supplies and chokes rivers and other bodies of water. Worse yet, the meat and dairy industries are now recognized as a leading contributor to climate change.
"
15,Do vegans get enough vitamin B12?,"Vegans can get B12 through fortified soy milk, marmite and savoury yeast flakes. B12 has also been added to some other vegan products (eg. some Sanitarium burgers, sausages and ice ‘creams’ – check labels though as some Sanitarium products contain eggs and dairy).

We recommend that vegans take a B12 supplement as any B12 present in plant foods is not easily absorbed into the body. It is important to also realise B12 is usually supplemented into ‘livestock’ animals diets too, so there is no ‘natural’ way for getting B12 in today’s society."
16,If we all went vegan – wouldn't all the animals die out?,"It's true that the number of animals will fall as farmers breed fewer and fewer animals as the years go by. Farmed animals live a controlled, distorted life, often filled with pain and fear. 

The vast majority of farmed animals are kept in indoor units where they never see the light of day. Those that are kept outside are only kept alive for a fraction of their natural lifespans before being slaughtered for meat - often in the most barbaric manner imaginable. 

All farmed animals are born to die at our command. In a vegan world animals would not be kept for profit and greed but would be allowed to exist in their natural state and live their life in freedom."
17,"If we all went vegan, we’d be overrun with animals?","Farmed animals are not allowed to reproduce naturally and farmers only breed animals when they can make a profit out of doing so. 

As demand for meat goes down over time, so fewer and fewer animals will be bred. That means that we will not be overrun by millions of farmed animals, as some people seem to imagine. Eventually, the few that are left can be allowed to go free: pigs can root around in woodlands as it is natural for them to do, sheep will graze the hillsides like deer and so on. 

Their populations will find their own natural levels, just like every other animal."
18,"If you were stuck on a desert island, would you eat meat?","Maybe – but if you were stuck on a desert island you might have to run around naked, never take a shower and wipe your bottom with leaves: that doesn’t mean that you should do those things the rest of the time."
19,Is alcohol vegan?,"Most spirits are vegan, although there are the more obvious ones that contain cream or honey that are not. 

Most wines and beers go through a filtering process, often using animal products. Such filtering agents include milk, albumen (from eggs), isinglass (from the swim bladders of fish) and gelatine. Labelling regulations require allergens such as milk and egg to be listed on labels, but it is not a requirement for isinglass or gelatine. 

Coopers, Boags and Heineken beers are all vegan. While almost all German (and Belgian) beers are vegan because of their laws for purity!"
20,Is honey vegan?,"Honey is an animal product and is therefore avoided by vegans. Surprisingly, a lot of bees are factory farmed and live in unnatural conditions. The queen is often artificially inseminated, has her wings clipped and is replaced (killed) after 1 or 2 years (normal life span is around 5 years). Try using agave nectar, maple syrup or golden syrup instead."
21,Is it more expensive?,"Being vegan needn’t be more expensive than a diet containing animal products. Some of the cheapest and healthiest foods available are great staples of a vegan diet, including cereals, beans, rice, potatoes, lentils, pasta, bread, fruits and vegetables. 

If you’re eating a balanced diet that includes animal products, you likely already buy and enjoy many of these anyway. 

Some vegan items such as vegan milks and cheese can be more expensive than their non-vegan counterparts, but this additional outlay is likely to be balanced by the savings you make through not having to buy meat."
22,"Is it possible to really be vegan, when animal ingredients are everywhere?","Although it’s true that in today’s world, it is almost impossible to avoid using some non-vegan items or ingredients, it is also true that avoiding most of them is easier than you think. 

The rising number of vegans each year has created an increased demand for vegan products. So much so that today, there are many incredibly delicious, easily attainable, and easy to prepare substitutes that would have seemed miraculous to vegan pioneers, such as pizza and ice cream! "
23,Is palm oil vegan?,"In itself, palm oil is a vegetable product which does not need to involve the (ab)use of animals, and therefore is suitable for vegans. The palm oil and palm timber industries are rife with very bad practices. In the EU, palm oil used in food must now be labelled, but ingredients derived from palm oil in food and non-food products still do not have to be labelled."
24,Is veganism healthy?,"Well-planned vegan diets contain all the nutrients we need to remain healthy. 

The British Dietetic Association (BDA) is the professional association for dietitians in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The BDA recognises that well-planned vegan diets can support healthy living in people of all ages. It's always a great idea to pay attention to nutritional needs, but this applies to everyone, not just vegans. Going vegan is great opportunity to pay more attention to your diet and health. The"
25,Isn’t it expensive to be vegan?,"There’s plenty of cheap yet high-quality vegan food out there, and the trick to finding it all is learning how to shop effectively. 

Once you learn a few basic shopping tips, it’s actually easier to eat an affordable vegan diet than one that contains animal products. The key to being vegan on the cheap is to buy unprocessed foods in bulk. Every good natural foods store has a bulk section where you can buy everything from beans to grains to nuts to granola. If you can keep most of your purchases to items costing under $3 a pound your grocery bill will be remarkably low."
26,It’s alright to eat animals if they’ve had a good life?,"Would it be alright to kill and eat people if they’d had a good life? And what do we mean by a ‘good’ life, anyway? In the case of animals, we certainly don’t mean a long one. 

‘Meat’ animals are killed as babies in the case of lambs and veal calves or as soon as they become physically mature – the equivalent of human teenagers - and never get to lead any kind of adult life. Animals, of course, want to live just as much as we do. "
27,What about medicine? Is medicine vegan?,Medicines prescribed by doctors are normally first tested on non-human animals. This is unavoidable under current laws. What you can do is ask your doctor for medicines that possibly don't contain animal ingredients. Medicines usually come with an information leaflet listing the ingredients. Ask your pharmacist for advice too.
28,What are some good milk alternatives?,"There is a wide variety of non-dairy milks available. Your local supermarket is likely to stock the more common items such as soy, almond and rice milks, and many health food shops, organic stores and Asian supermarkets offer less common ones such as nut, oat, quinoa and hemp milks. These products can be found both on the shelf and in the refrigerated sections."
29,Does it make a difference if one person goes vegan?,"A huge difference. The average British meat eater consumes, in the course of their lifetime, 5 cattle, 20 pigs, 29 sheep and lambs, 780 chickens, 46 turkeys, 18 ducks, 7 rabbits, 1, geese and half-a-tonne of fish. 

That is a lot of lives saved. Just as importantly, the best advertisement for veganism is a healthy and happy vegan: if you turn vegan you will be able to influence others to become part of the movement towards a more compassionate and rational world."
30,What is a vegan?,"Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. "
31,Is veganism good for your health?,"While no diet can guarantee a long and healthy life, becoming vegan may improve your odds. That’s largely because a vegan diet eliminates a number of unhealthful foods, including red and cured meats—two foods strongly linked to colon cancer. Vegans also tend to eat far more vegetables and fruits than non-vegetarians. Studies consistently show that people who eat the most fruits and vegetables tend to enjoy better health."
32,Why go vegan?,"A vegan lifestyle prevents a tremendous amount of animal slaughter and suffering. It offers a potent way to shrink our environmental footprint, especially in regard to climate change. And a well-planned vegan diet can fuel the highest levels of fitness, while reducing our risk of various chronic diseases. Plus, the food is insanely delicious and it becomes more widely available every year."
33,Why not just avoid factory farmed foods?,"Unless specifically labeled to the contrary, you can assume that every animal product came from a factory farm.

As we’ve seen, every sort of cruelty is rampant at these places. A number of omnivores have pushed back against factory farm cruelties by demanding higher animal welfare standards. Most natural foods stores and supermarkets sell specially-labeled animal products from farms that promise better animal welfare. "
34,Will I need to supplement calcium if I don’t eat dairy?,"Not necessarily, you can get an adequate amount of calcium from a vegan diet. Good sources of calcium include green leafy vegetables, baked beans, black beans, dried figs, tahini and almonds. As well as this most plant milks are fortified with calcium too. In Australia the recommended calcium intake for adults ranges from 1000 to 1300 mg of calcium per day."
35,When was veganism created?,The term “vegan” was coined by the British animal rights activist Donald Watson in the 1940s. “Vegan” describes the philosophy that animals should not be exploited and hurt for food or other purposes.
36,Can you be an athlete on a vegan diet?,"From ultramarathoner Rich Roll and Olympian Carl Lewis to US Open winner Serena Williams, vegans prove time and again that you don’t need to support animal torture to be a star athlete."
37,Don't cows like being milked though?,"Though it may seem obvious, many people have no idea that in order to produce milk, cows have to be pregnant or have just given birth. Like all other mammals, cows lactate for their babies."
38,Isn't fixing human suffering and caring for human life more important?,Who says we can’t be vegan AND work to end human suffering? By choosing a humane vegan diet you are helping people as well as animals! 
39,How do vegans make cake?,"Many vegans like to use egg replacers, which are easy to make at home. Typical substitutes can include things like banana, flaxseed, applesauce and chia seeds."
40,Are vegans against pets? Would a vegan have pets?,"Pets are a blurry area for veganism, the reason for being how they're acquired. Pet shop practices that bring pets into existence are harmful to animals. If you can rescue an animal and have all the correct facilities and ability to keep them happy and healthy - then there is no issue."
41,Are vegans against wool? What do vegans think of wool?,"Most vegans are against wool, this is because wool is obtained by raising sheep with the sole purpose of shearing their wollen fleece. "
42,Who is the oldest vegan?,"The woman Loreen Dinwiddie lived to the age of 109, including 88 years she stuck to a strict vegan diet."
43,Do vegans live longer?,"On average, vegans and vegetarians live longer – they have longer life expectancies than meat-eaters, and grow old with fewer health issues. ... But, on average, vegans and vegetarians do live longer – they have lower mortality rates than meat-eaters, and grow old with fewer health issues (1)."
44,What would happen if everyone was vegan?,"According to a new study, a nation of 320 million vegans would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture by some 28%, far less than the amount now produced by the livestock industry."
45,"Animals Would Eat Us if They Could, and They Eat Each Other","Animals do all sorts of things to each other (and to us), including eating each other. Does this make it okay for us to do the same thing? There are three main issues with this.

The first is that not all animals eat each other - cows, for instance, are herbivores, so it seems a little unfair for us to eat them on the basis of other animals eating each other.
The second, much bigger issue is that animal behavior doesn't excuse our own behavior, because animals aren't able to understand or act according to morality. Like infants, they aren't responsible for what they do. The fact that an infant poops and vomits all over me doesn't show that it's okay for me to poop and vomit all over you. Unlike the infant, I have the ability to make moral choices."
46,Why should animals have rights?,"Why should children have rights?Why should the mentally handicapped have rights?Why should dogs have rights? (BTW, our pets have LOTS of rights)

Why should people from other countries have rights?

Why should anyone other than yourself have rights?

The answer to those questions is all the same: Because it's the right thing to do, because we want the right to our own body and life, and we have the capacity to understand that other beings, whether they can voice this desire or not, should be entitled to the same right."
47,Would you kill animals to control an invaisive species?,"A species is considered invasive due to either rapid reproduction or rapid destruction of another species. A species which does not rapidly reproduce and/or cause a rapid decline in another species is not invasive, it is a threat. By definition, an invasive species must be dealt with using death. There a number of ways to control species threats such as displacement, isolation, deterrence or other methods, however, invasive-species are are ones which adversely affect the environment.

Invasive animal species are quite often characterized as fast breeding, rapid growth, ability to live off a wide range of food types, strong tolerance to environmental changes and phenotypic plasticity.

What this means is a successful invasive species can eat anything, reproduces and grows fast, spreads quickly, is robust to environmental change and is able to rapidly change its immediate evolution (phenotype) to suit the demands of the new region. It becomes apparent quite quickly that there are two problems, invasive species compete for food and territory and food, as well as over-exhausting prey populations & they, outbreed native species.

There is only one solution to combat invasive species, you must ensure they don't breed. You could try to relocate them, but due to their rapid reproduction and growth and alarming dispersal, if they're not placed in a suitable ecosystem, they will become invasive in that one too. To ensure invasive species don't breed, you can either neuter them or you can kill them.

To break that down - neutering is a resource intensive solution and as identified, invasive species rapidly reproduce and mature. By the time a species is declared invasive, that is already a substantial population to capture, neuter and then release, to then cause destruction and death to the rest of the environment. The other problem with the solution of neutering is that if you see a feral animal, there is no effective way to tell if it is neutered or not.

The alternative is to simply declare those feral animals in certain areas to be killed. This is highly cost-effective and resource efficient, so much so that there is an actual industry for profitable varmit control - there is not a profitable industry for environmental conservation."
48,Would you eat roadkill?,"Roadkill is a great source of meat for obligate carnivores. If humans want to eat it, feel free, but since it is by no means necessary, I can't for the life of me understand why someone would."
49,Can zoos be ethical?,"There are three main ethical problems with zoos:

They normalize the idea that animals are only good for human pleasure and entertainment.

The animals on display are often kept in cramped, unnatural environments that take a toll on their mental health and general well being.

Keeping predators means keeping a supply chain of cheap meat to feed them. Zoos make little to no effort to ethically source their animal feed.

It's possible in principle to overcome these obstacles. It requires putting the animals' interests strictly higher than the human zoo patrons'. In practice, I think this would look more like an animal sanctuary than a zoo."
50,Where do vegans get Iron from?,"Iron is also a mineral, so it also comes from the ground like calcium. Most people can accept the mineral issue once you point it out to them but still have a hard time imagining that you can obtain enough iron through plants alone."
51,What About Omega 3 Fatty Acids?,"flax and chia are chock full of omega 3 fats, as are walnuts and hemp seeds"
52,is soy or soya bad for us?,"Evidence suggests that soya is not a threat to our health and is in fact a reliable and healthy protein source. Vegans aren't required to eat soya and it's possible to enjoy a healthy, well-balanced diet without it."
53,Can my dog/cat go vegan?,"Generally speaking most dogs and cats can follow a vegan diet. There are several good brands of vegan animal food available across the world, and these can be ordered online or found in some vegan stores. Dogs and particularly cats need an amino acid called taurine, which must be present in their food as it is essential for their wellbeing. This amino acid is found in animal products: however, it is also synthetically created on a commercial scale and is added to good quality vegan animal foods"
55,If an animal is dead already can we eat them?,"We can go onto say that the animals are bred purely for you to eat them, so stop eating them and they will stop being bred for slaughter. Last year 400 million less animals were bred to be killed due to people decreasing their meat intake."
56,Which country is best for vegans?," The UK was the most popular country for veganism in 2019, according to Google Trends, followed by the Australia and New Zealand."
57,How many chickens are killed each year?,"Globally, more than 66 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of food, for both their meat and eggs."
59,What is speciesism?,"“Speciesism” is the human-held belief that all other animal species are inferior. Speciesist thinking involves considering animals—who have their own desires, needs, and complex lives—as means to human ends. This supremacist line of “reasoning” is used to defend treating other living, feeling beings as property, objects, or even ingredients. It’s a bias rooted in denying others their own agency, interests, and self-worth, often for personal gain.
"
61,What is veganism's stance on faux fur?,"Our goal is to reduce the sum total of animal suffering. For people who want the look of real fur, faux fur can be a good alternative. It’s important to note, though, that news reports have indicated that major retailers have been found selling real fur that was mislabeled as faux. Of course, if you ever have any doubts about whether an item contains real or faux fur, the best choice is to avoid it altogether.
"
62,Is tattoo ink vegan?,"A tattoo can be a creative, eye-catching way to display your passion for animal rights. However, some tattoo inks are actually made with animal products. Nonvegan varieties may contain bone char, glycerin from animal fat, gelatin from hooves, or shellac from beetles. So as you’re checking out tattoo shops, ask if they use vegan inks or if they can order some for you. Some great vegan brands include Eternal, StarBrite, SkinCandy, and Stable Color. 

You may also want to take along your own razor, since the ones they have in-house may have a gel strip made from glycerin. And of course, you’ll want your tattoo-care products to be vegan as well. Try The Merry Hempsters Vegan Hemp Tattoo Balm, Black Cat Vitamin Infusion Serum, Ohana Organics Tattoo Butter, or even jojoba oil, olive oil, or shea butter. No matter what artwork you choose, your vegan tattoo will be an animal rights conversation piece!
"
63,What is gelatin made of?,"Gelatin is a protein obtained by boiling skin, tendons, ligaments, and/or bones with water. It is usually obtained from cows or pigs. Gelatin is used in shampoos, face masks, and other cosmetics; as a thickener for fruit gelatins and puddings (such as Jell-O); in candies, marshmallows, cakes, ice cream, and yogurts; on photographic film; and in vitamins as a coating and as capsules, and it is sometimes used to assist in “clearing” wines. Gelatin is not vegan. However, there is a product called “agar agar” that is sometimes marketed as “gelatin,” but it is vegan. It is derived from a type of seaweed.

Kosher symbols and markings are not reliable indicators on which vegans or vegetarians should base their purchasing decisions. This issue is complex, but the “K” or “Kosher” symbols basically mean that the food-manufacturing process was overseen by a rabbi, who theoretically ensures that it meets Hebrew dietary laws. The food also may not contain both dairy products and meat, but it may contain one or the other. “P” or “Parve” means that the product contains no meat or dairy products, but it may contain fish or eggs. Kosher gelatin is usually made from a fish source. “D,” as in “Kosher D,” means that the product either contains milk or was made with dairy machinery. For example, a chocolate and peanut candy may be marked “Kosher D” even if it doesn’t contain milk because the nondairy chocolate was manufactured on machinery that also made milk chocolate.
Can’t believe that your Jell-O actually was alive? Check out more disgusting things that might be hiding in your food.
"
64,How do aquariums treat marine mammals?,"Marine mammals—highly intelligent, sensitive, social beings—suffer greatly in captivity. The chlorine and copper sulfate used to keep tanks clean has caused dolphins’ skin to peel off and may cause them to go blind. Many marine mammals suffer from peptic ulcers, often resulting in death, because of frustration from their unnatural lives in captivity. Captivity also tears families apart. In the wild, orcas often spend their entire lives with their mothers and siblings. Wild dolphins swim together in family pods of three to 10 individuals or in tribes of hundreds.
While the aquarium industry claims that it exists purely for education and conservation, what aquariums really teach is that it is acceptable to keep animals in captivity, bored, cramped, lonely, far from their natural homes, and at the mercy of people. Marine mammal conservation is achieved through the abolition of whaling, the cleanup of our oceans, the end of driftnet fishing, and a prohibition on live captures—not through forcing whales and dolphins to swim in endless circles for our entertainment.
Captive displays stand in contrast to the truly educational experiences that many facilities offer, such as the opportunity to see marine mammals swim freely in their ocean home via whale- and dolphin-watching boat trips. Aquariums could also broadcast real-time videos of marine mammal rehabilitation efforts into their theaters, on the Internet, and into classrooms. There are countless ways to educate the public and cultivate respect for animals without imprisoning dolphins and whales—it’s time to put the focus on teaching visitors how to protect marine life rather than harm it. For more information, see PETA’s factsheet on Marine Mammal Parks.
"
67,Couldn’t we just build more animal shelters rather than euthanize dogs and cats?,"
A shelter should be a temporary compromise for dogs and cats. It is not a solution to companion animal homelessness. Dogs and cats need more than food, water, and shelter from the elements. They need and deserve loving care, regular human companionship, respect for their individuality, and the opportunity to play and run. As difficult as it may be for us to accept, euthanasia (carried out by veterinarians or shelter staff trained in intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital) is often the most compassionate and dignified way for unwanted animals to leave this uncaring world.
"
69,What’s wrong with wearing wool?,"As with other industries where animals are raised for a profit, the interests of the animals used in the wool industry are rarely considered. Flocks usually consist of thousands of sheep, and individual attention to their needs is virtually impossible. Many people believe that shearing sheep helps animals who might otherwise be burdened with too much wool, but without human interference, sheep grow just enough wool to protect themselves from temperature extremes.

Australia produces about a quarter of all wool used worldwide. Within weeks of birth, lambs’ ears are hole-punched, their tails are chopped off, and the males are castrated without anesthetics. Shearers are usually paid by volume, not by the hour, which encourages fast work without regard for the welfare of the sheep. Says one eyewitness: “[T]he shearing shed must be one of the worst places in the world for cruelty to animals … I have seen shearers punch sheep with their shears or their fists until the sheep’s nose bled. I have seen sheep with half their faces shorn off …”"
70,Is wine vegan?,"The majority of people are unaware that wine, although made from grapes, may have been made using animal-derived products. During the winemaking process, the liquid is filtered through substances called “fining agents.” This process is used to remove protein, yeast, cloudiness, “off” flavors and colorings, and other organic particles. "
72,Which candies are vegan?,"It’s no secret that vegans love to eat, and we like our sweets just as much as the next person. Fortunately, loads of candies are vegan, so we can indulge our cravings (mostly) guilt-free. Most dark chocolate is vegan, as are popular sweet treats such as Smarties (known as Rockets in Canada), Oreos, Airheads, Jujubes, and Swedish Fish (some Swedish Fish contain beeswax, so be sure to check the label)."
73,Which cosmetics are cruelty-free?,"View our list of consumer product companies that don’t cruelly test their products on animals.
"
76,How Do vegans Feel About Horseback Riding?,"In a perfect world, horses would be free to pursue their own lives and humans wouldn’t make demands of them. They’re herd animals who in nature, associate with other members of their large groups, graze in meadows, travel great distances, play, and engage in courtship behavior. They have needs, wants, and interests that are entirely independent from what humans ask and expect from them.


If we look honestly at our relationship with horses, we must acknowledge that the decision to take part in horseback riding is made solely by one individual with little benefit to and no input from the other.

We can connect with horses in our care and have a meaningful and mutually beneficial relationship with these sensitive animals without climbing on top of them.
"
77,What’s wrong with chaining dogs?,"
Condemning dogs to “solitary confinement” on a chain is so cruel that it is illegal in some cities. Chained dogs are exposed to searing heat, bitter cold, rain, and wind, putting them at risk for heat exhaustion, frostbite, and exposure. Chains can wrap around trees or other objects, water bowls can easily tip over, and food can quickly spoil in summer or freeze in winter."
78,What should I do if I can no longer keep my companion animal?,"
Having to give away a companion animal can be very traumatic for you and certainly for your animal. If circumstances make it impossible for you to keep or properly care for your animal and if you have exhausted resources such as trusted friends and relatives, don’t rush into a placement just because you are pressured for time. If you are unable to find an excellent home for your animal, take him or her to an animal shelter operated by a humane organization. Don’t avoid a shelter just because it performs euthanasia."
79,What’s wrong with eating honey?,"Unfortunately, like factory farmers, many beekeepers take inhumane steps to ensure personal safety and reach production quotas. It’s not unusual for larger honey producers to cut off the queen bee’s wings so that she can’t leave the colony or to have her artificially inseminated on a bee-sized version of the factory farm “rape rack.” 

When the keeper wants to move a queen to a new colony, she is carried with “bodyguard” bees, all of whom—if they survive transport—will be killed by bees in the new colony. Bees may be killed or have their wings and legs torn off by haphazard handling. According to the Cook-DuPage Beekeepers Association, humans have been using honey since about 15,000 B.C., but it wasn’t until the 20th century that people turned bees into factory-farmed animals. 

Happily, many sweeteners are made without killing bees: Rice syrup, molasses, sorghum, Sucanat, barley malt, maple syrup, organic cane sugar, and dried fruit or fruit concentrates can replace honey in recipes. Using these will keep your diet bee-free.
"
81,How does eating meat harm the environment?,"When land is used to raise animals instead of crops, precious water and soil are lost, trees are cut down to make land for grazing or factory-farm sheds, and untreated animal waste pollutes rivers and streams. In fact, it has such a devastating effect on all aspects of our environment that the Union of Concerned Scientists lists meat-eating as one of the biggest environmental hazards facing the Earth. Globally, animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gases than all the world’s transportation systems combined. No wonder, when you consider facts like these:
 
"
84,Do vegans advocate spaying and neutering of companion animals?,"Yes, vigorously! Each year, 6-8 million precious animals will enter the front doors of animal shelters—and 3-4 million of them will go out the back doors in body bags. All of this misery and death could be prevented through spaying and neutering (surgical sterilization). Every stray cat and every neglected dog came from an animal who wasn’t spayed or neutered.

By preventing animals from being born, we prevent animals from being hit by cars, infected with lingering, painful diseases, attacked by other animals or cruel people, stolen by laboratory dealers, used as bait by dogfighters, or simply stuck outside to die of starvation, exposure, or neglect."
85,What are pocket pets?,"“Pocket pets” are exotic animals, such as prairie dogs, flying squirrels, spiny mice, and hedgehogs, whose popularity as fad pets has skyrocketed in recent years. Although their small size may make them look cute and cuddly, “pocket pets” are wild animals who have very special husbandry requirements. They suffer from the stress of being confined to small cages, are generally fed an improper diet, and are often forced to have an unnaturally high number of litters. 

Trauma and injuries result when these animals are handled improperly and dropped. “Pocket pets” frequently wind up in climates that they are not suited for and are tossed aside when a new fad arises. They can also be dangerous and carry the risk of disease."
87,What should I do if I find feral or stray animals?,"
If feral or stray animals turn up at your doorstep, don’t assume that they have homes and are just visiting. It never hurts to err on the side of caution and take them in. If they have families, your signs and ads will bring them running. If they don’t have homes, your intervention could save their lives.

Stray and feral animals can rarely survive long on their own. They die of disease, poisoning, starvation, theft by laboratory dealers, and worse. "
88,What’s wrong with keeping birds in cages?,"
All caged birds are either captured or captive-bred. In the wild, these beautiful beings are never alone, and if separated even for just a moment, they call wildly to their flockmates. Flock-oriented, they preen each other, fly together, play, and share egg-incubation duties. Many species of birds mate for life and share parenting tasks. Most birds will not take a second mate in the wild if their first is lost.

Life in captivity is often a death sentence for birds, who may suffer from malnutrition, an improper environment, loneliness, and the stress of confinement. Birds are meant to fly and be with others of their own kind in a natural environment. Confinement causes birds to have temper tantrums and mood swings."
91,"I have an ant problem. I’d rather not kill the ants, but I do want to get rid of them. What should I do?","
Avoid using insect sprays. Pesticides are the number two cause of household poisonings in the U.S., as people and companion animals breathe in the toxic air. 

The best way to keep ants out of your house safely and naturally is by using products you may have in your kitchen cabinets right now. Try pouring a line of cream of tartar, red chili powder, paprika, or dried peppermint at the place where you think ants might be entering the house; they won’t cross it. 

You can also try washing countertops, cabinets, and floors with equal parts vinegar and water. To keep insects out in the first place, fill holes and cracks in walls with caulk or white glue. Finally, probably the most important thing you can do is to avoid giving insects a food supply, by keeping living areas clean. Be careful to sweep up crumbs, wash dishes immediately, store food in tightly sealed containers, and empty garbage frequently.
"
92,Is it safe to feed my dog or cat a vegetarian diet?,"“A growing body of evidence appears to indicate that dogs and cats can survive, and indeed thrive, on nutritionally-sound vegetarian and vegan diets,” according to Andrew Knight and Madelaine Leitsberger, the authors of a review in the journal Animals of four studies that examined the nutritional adequacy of vegetarian diets for cats and dogs. 

One study comparing the health of vegetarian cats to that of cats on conventional diets found no significant differences in perceived health status between the two groups.

Some dogs are even sensitive to meat and do better without it for that reason. Many commercial meat-based dog and cat foods contain ingredients that are harmful to them, such as pesticides, hormones, antibiotics, preservatives, poor-quality fillers, and parts of animals that are deemed unfit for human consumption, such as ground-up feathers and diseased flesh."
94,Do you approve of electric fences and shock collars?,"Electronic fences and shock collars electrically shock dogs when they cross an invisible line, bark, or don’t respond to a command. 


These cruel devices physically hurt animals and can cause severe psychological problems as well. Companion animals should not have to live in fear of receiving electric shocks for normal behavior, such as barking. Positive training methods, in which dogs are rewarded for what they do right, are kinder and more effective.


Dogs trained with shock collars and electric fences may develop fears of or aggression aimed at what they BELIEVE is the source of the shock (kids riding by on bikes, the mailman, the dog next door, etc.). Dogs have been known to run through electric barriers when frightened by fireworks or chasing a squirrel, and then are scared to cross back through the barrier.
It’s also worth noting that while electric fences may keep your dog inside the yard, they do nothing to protect your companion from other roaming dogs, cruel humans, or other animals who can freely enter the property.
"
96,What should I do if an ingredient seems questionable but is not included on the list of animal ingredients and their alternatives?,"
The list is not exhaustive. There are thousands of technical and patented names for ingredient variations. In fact, some ingredients go by the same name whether they are of animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin. If you have a question regarding a product’s ingredients, call the manufacturer directly.
"
97,What’s so bad about eating eggs?,"Chickens don’t need to be killed for their eggs, right? While both male and female chickens can be raised for meat, only females can produce eggs, so about 346 million male chicks per year are disposed of by being shoved into plastic bags and left to suffocate. 


They cannot be raised profitably as “broilers” or “fryers” because they have not been engineered to produce a lot of muscle.


Conditions at egg factory farms are atrocious. Cage floors are of wire mesh so waste falls from the upper tiers onto the chickens below. A single cage, roughly 16 by 18 inches, holds five to six hens, each with a wingspan of 32 inches."
98,What is veganism's position on euthanasia?,"
Every day in the United States, tens of thousands of puppies and kittens are born. Compare this to the nearly 11,000 human births each day, and it’s clear that there can never be enough homes for all these animals. Shelters are stuck with the heartrending job of dealing with animals nobody wants. Those who refuse to spay and neuter their animals, who abandon animals when they grow tired of them, and who patronize pet shops instead of adopting stray or shelter animals make euthanasia a tragic necessity.
"
99,What industries am I supporting when I buy products that use animal ingredients?,"
Animal ingredients come from every industry that uses animals—the meat, fur, wool, dairy, egg, and fishing industries as well as industries such as horseracing and rodeo, which send unwanted animals to slaughter.
"
100,Do vegans endorse the companies that are noted as cruelty-free?,"
Inclusion in the cruelty-free section does not imply endorsement of any company or product by vegans. We encourage consumers to shop responsibly and to question companies about their products and business practices before making any purchase.
"
111,Do medical students have to dissect or experiment on animals?,"
No. Many leading medical schools, including Harvard, Yale, and Stanford, now use innovative, clinical teaching methods instead of animal laboratories. 


Harvard Cardiac Anesthesia Practicum, which allows students to observe human heart bypass operations, has eliminated any need for the old dog lab, in which students gave dogs drugs that induced heart attacks. Many students all over the world now graduate without harming any animals. 


In Great Britain, it is against the law for medical students to practice surgery on animals, and British physicians are as competent as those educated elsewhere.
"
112,"How can non-animal tests show us the complex interactions of cells, tissues, and organs?","
Different species of animals vary so enormously in their reactions to toxins and diseases and in their metabolism of drugs that studies with animals are not good indicators for people. 


For example, a dose of aspirin that is therapeutic in humans is poisonous to cats and has no effect on fever in horses; benzene causes leukemia in humans but not in mice; insulin produces birth defects in animals but not in humans, and so on. Today’s sophisticated “super” computers can actually predict the effect of substances on all the organs of the human body.
"
113,Don’t most scientists care about animals because their research depends on the animals’ well-being?,"Investigations at our most prestigious institutions show that this is not the case. 


At the City of Hope in California, one of the country’s most prominent research facilities, animals starved to death and drowned in their own feces. Many experimenters become calloused after years of research and refuse to see the animals’ suffering. They treat animals as disposable tools for research and fight laws that would improve the animals’ care.
"
114,"I’ve seen a few products with labels that say, “This finished product not tested on animals.” Does that mean that the individual ingredients have been tested on animals?","
In cases like these, the product could be completely cruelty-free or the status of the ingredients could be questionable. It depends upon the company.
 
For example, both Bath & Body Works and Aveda use similar statements on their packaging, and neither company tests ingredients on animals. This statement is often used to meet language requirements when products marketed in both the U.S. and the U.K. use the same packaging in both countries.
 
Since most ingredients have been tested on animals by someone at some time in the past, England does not allow a company to include phrases such as “no animal testing” on its products, even if that company has not conducted animal tests on its ingredients.
"
115,What can be done about animal tests that are required by law?,"
Although animal testing of certain pharmaceuticals and chemicals is still mandated by law, the arguments against animals testing of cosmetics and household products are also valid when applied to the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. These industries are regulated by the FDA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), respectively, and it is the responsibility of the companies that kill animals in order to bring their products to market to convince these regulatory agencies that there is a better way to determine product safety. 
 
 
Companies resist progress because the crude nature of animal testing allows them to market products that might be determined to be too toxic if cell culture tests were used. Let companies know how you feel about this.
"
116,Why do companies continue to test products on animals?,"
Companies test on animals to provide data that they can use to defend themselves when they are sued by injured consumers—even though some courts have ruled that the FDA has failed to show that the results of animal tests can be extrapolated to humans. The unreliability of animal tests allows companies to put virtually any product on the market.
 

If cosmetics or household products blind or poison animals during tests, they are often marketed anyway. Companies use the fact that the products have been tested—rather than the actual test results—to support the claim that they are conscientious. In most cases, companies settle out of court, preferring to pay off the injured consumer rather than bring the unreliability of their testing practices to light. In some cases, courts have ruled in favor of the injured consumers. 

 
In the end, animal tests protect no one.
"
117,Does the law require animal testing for cosmetics and household products?,"
Absolutely not! Neither the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) nor the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission requires that cosmetics or household products be tested on animals. There is sufficient existing safety data, as well as in vitro alternatives, to make animal testing obsolete for these products. 

While it is true that virtually every ingredient—even water—has been tested on animals in the past, we can help prevent future animal testing by buying only from cruelty-free companies.
"
118,Animals in cages on factory farms or in laboratories don’t suffer that much because they’ve never known anything else.,"Humans and animals alike have instincts that they are born with, regardless of where they are raised. 


In addition to the physical suffering—muscle pain, skeletal deformities, respiratory illnesses, and other chronic ailments—caused by intensive confinement, being prevented from performing the most basic instinctual behaviors causes tremendous mental anguish. Even animals caged since birth want to move around, groom themselves, stretch their limbs or wings, and exercise. 


Studies at Bristol University in England revealed that when factory-farmed chickens who grew up crammed into wire cages were freed, they naturally began to dust-bathe and build nests for their eggs. Herd animals and flock animals become distressed when they are made to live in isolation or when they are put in groups too large for them to be able to recognize other members.


In addition, all confined animals suffer from intense boredom—some so severely that it can lead to self-mutilation or other self-destructive behavior, which farmers “solve” by pulling teeth and chopping off beaks and tails.
"
119,"Is animal experimentation acceptable if it helps animals, too, by advancing veterinary science?","
This is like asking whether it’s acceptable to experiment on poor children to benefit rich ones. 


The point is not whether animal experimentation can be useful to animals or humans; the point is that we should not inflict suffering on those who are at our mercy. Veterinary medicine, like human medicine, is increasingly dependent upon studies that don’t harm some animals in an effort to help others. 


These include computer modeling, cell research, epidemiological research, and clinical studies designed to help animals who are already ill.
"
121,Does animal experimentation save human lives?,"
More lives could be saved and suffering stopped by educating people on the importance of avoiding fat and cholesterol, the dangers of smoking, reducing alcohol and other drug consumption, exercising regularly, and cleaning up the environment than by all the animal tests in the world.



And, as George Bernard Shaw once said, “You do not settle whether an experiment is justified or not by merely showing that it is of some use. The distinction is not between useful and useless experiments, but between barbarous and civilized behavior.” There are some medical problems that can probably only be cured by testing on unwilling people, but we don’t do it because we recognize that it would be wrong. We need to extend this same concern to other living, feeling beings, regardless of what species they may be.
"
122,Hasn’t every major medical advance been attributable to experiments on animals?,"
Medical historians have shown that improved nutrition, sanitation, and other behavioral and environmental factors—not anything learned from animal experiments—are responsible for the decline in deaths since 1900 from the most common infectious diseases and that medicine has had little to do with increased life expectancy. 


The role of animal studies in the development of many treatments has been exaggerated and twisted to fit the goals of those who promote animal experimentation. For example, the development of the polio vaccine involved two separate bodies of work—the in vitro or non-animal studies, which were awarded the Nobel Prize, and the subsequent animal experiments in which close to 1 million animals were killed and which the Nobel committee refused to recognize as anything more than wasteful. Early polio studies on animals misled researchers about the route of infection and delayed the development of a vaccine for decades.


It’s impossible to say where we would be today if we had refused to experiment on animals, because throughout medical history, very few resources have been devoted to non-animal research methods. We do know that animal experiments frequently give misleading results and many believe we’d probably be better off if we hadn’t relied on them and ignored avenues of research more relevant to humans, including epidemiological and cell research.
"
123,"Would you approve an experiment that would sacrifice 10 animals to save 10,000 people?","
Suppose the only way to save those 10,000 people was to experiment on one mentally challenged orphan. If saving people is the goal, wouldn’t that be worth it? Most people will agree that it is wrong to sacrifice one human for the “greater good” of others because it would violate that individual’s rights. There is no logical reason to deny animals the same rights that protect individual humans from being sacrificed for the common good.
"
127,Is there anything wrong with experiments that don’t harm animals?,"
If there really is no harm—when animals are observed in their own environments, for example—we don’t object. 

But keeping animals isolated in barren steel cages, removed from all that is natural to them, is harmful to animals’ mental and physical health.
"
129,Aren’t humans natural carnivores?,"
While humans have eaten meat throughout history, there is significant evidence that we are better suited to a vegetarian diet. 


Carnivorous animals have long, curved fangs, claws, and a short digestive tract. Humans have flat, flexible nails, and our so-called “canine” teeth are minuscule compared to carnivores’. Human teeth are better suited to biting into vegetables, fruits, and grains than tearing through tough hides.


In addition, the health problems associated with meat consumption—a leading contributor to heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and obesity—should be an indication that we aren’t “meant” to eat meat. In addition, humans are capable of making ethical decisions. We can get all the nutrients we need from plant sources, which means that billions of animals are unnecessarily slaughtered every year at the expense of our health and the environment.
"
130,"Animals kill other animals for food, so why shouldn’t we?","
Most of the animals who kill for food could not survive if they didn’t. That is not the case for us. We are better off not eating meat. Many other animals are vegetarians, including some of our closest primate relatives. Why don’t we look to them as our example instead of to carnivores?
"
133,Vegetarianism is a personal choice. Why are you trying to force it on everyone else?,"
From a moral standpoint, actions that harm others are not matters of personal choice. Murder, child abuse, and cruelty to animals are all immoral. Our society now encourages meat-eating and the cruelty of factory farming, but history teaches that society also once encouraged slavery, child labor, and many other practices now universally recognized as wrong.
"
134,The only meat I still eat is fish. Can fish feel pain?,"Research has shown that indeed they can. According to Dr. Donald Broom, animal welfare advisor to the British government, “Anatomically, physiologically, and biologically, the pain system in fish is virtually the same as in birds and mammals.” 


Fish have fully developed brains and nervous systems and very sensitive mouths. 


Fish use their tongues and mouths as humans might use their hands—to catch or gather food, build nests, and even hide their offspring from danger. Fish also experience fear. An Australian study found that when fish are chased, confined, or otherwise threatened, they react as humans do to stress: with increased heart and breathing rates and a burst of adrenalin.
 
"
135,"It’s OK to eat eggs because chickens lay them naturally. The eggs we buy in the supermarket are sterile and not unborn fetuses, right?","
The cruelty of egg production lies in the treatment of the “laying” hens themselves, who are perhaps the most abused of all factory-farmed animals. 


Up to five hens are packed into each cage the size of a filing cabinet drawer. The cages are stacked many tiers high; feces from the cages above fall onto the chickens below. Hens become lame and develop osteoporosis from forced immobility and calcium lost to produce egg shells. Some birds’ feet grow around the wire cage floors; they starve to death because they are unable to reach the food trough. At just 2 years of age, most hens are “spent” and sent to the slaughterhouse. Egg-laying hatcheries have no use for male chicks so they suffocate, decapitate, crush, or grind them up alive.


Each egg from today’s egg factory farms represents 22 hours of hell for a hen.
"
136,"The animals have to die sometime, don’t they?","
Humans do, too, but that doesn’t give us the right to kill them or cause them a lifetime of suffering.
"
137,Are all faux meats and dairy products vegan?,"
No. Be sure to read the ingredient list on the package before making a purchase. Common nonvegan ingredients to look out for are casein, whey, sodium caseinate, honey, egg whites, and cheese.
"
138,"What will we do with all those chickens, cows, and pigs if everyone becomes a vegetarian?","
It’s unrealistic to expect that everyone will stop eating animals overnight. As the demand for meat decreases, the number of animals bred will decrease. Farmers will stop breeding so many animals and will turn to other types of agriculture. When there are fewer of these animals, they will be able to live more natural lives.
"
139,What is a vegan?,"
A vegan (strict vegetarian) does not consume meat, dairy products, eggs, honey, or any product derived from an animal. A vegan diet can (and should) be full of a wide variety of delicious, nutritious foods, including vegetables, grains, nuts, legumes, seeds, and fruits. 


Vegans don’t wear leather, fur, silk, or wool. Many refuse to use products that are made with animal ingredients, products that are filtered using animal parts (such as some wines, beers, and white sugars), and products that have been tested on animals.
"
140,Isn’t eating meat natural? It’s been going on for thousands of years. Aren’t our bodies designed for it,"
Actually, human bodies are better suited to a vegetarian diet. Carnivorous animals have long, curved fangs, claws, and a short digestive tract. Humans have flat, flexible nails, and our so-called “canine” teeth are minuscule compared to those of carnivores or even compared to vegetarian primates like gorillas and orangutans. 


Our tiny canine teeth are better suited to biting into fruits than tearing through tough hides. We have flat molars and a long digestive tract suited to a diet of vegetables, fruits, and grain. Eating meat is hazardous to our health; it contributes to heart disease, cancer, and many other health problems.
"
141,How can a vegan get enough vitamin B12? Do vegans get enough B12?,"Vitamin B12 once occurred naturally on the surfaces of potatoes, beets, and other root vegetables, but the move away from natural fertilizers has caused it to disappear from our soil. 


Nutritionists recommend that vegans take a commercially available multivitamin or vitamin B12 supplement or eat foods that are fortified with this essential vitamin, such as many breakfast cereals, fortified orange juice and soy milk, and nutritional yeast. The Vegetarian Site offers a variety of B12 supplements in either lozenge or tablet form that make it easy and affordable to get the proper nutrients!
"
142,"If you were starving on a boat at sea and there were an animal on the boat, would you eat the animal?","
I don’t know. Humans will go to extremes to save their own lives, even if it means hurting someone innocent. (People have even killed and eaten other people in such situations.) This example, however, isn’t relevant to our daily choices. For most of us, there is no emergency and no excuse to kill animals for food.
"
143,Was Jesus really a vegetarian?,"Many biblical scholars believe that Jesus was a vegetarian. Jesus’ message is one of love and compassion, and there is nothing loving or compassionate about factory farms and slaughterhouses, where billions of animals live miserable lives and die violent, bloody deaths. Jesus mandates kindness, mercy, compassion, and love for all God’s creation. 


He would be appalled by the suffering that we inflict on animals just to indulge our acquired taste for their flesh.
We all have a choice. When we sit down to eat, we can add to the level of violence, misery, and death in the world, or we can respect God’s creation with a vegetarian diet.

144,"I’m a college student, and there are very few vegan options in my dining hall. Can you offer any advice?","
When students at the University of California at Berkeley first met with the university’s dining hall service to discuss “veganizing” their cafeteria, they received a lukewarm response. So the students set up a table with petitions right outside the dining hall. Within two weeks, they had collected 1,200 signatures—more than one-fifth of Berkeley’s dorm population! The students’ quest also attracted the attention of local reporters. “The media attention really helped us press our case,” says Leor Jacobi, one of the students who spearheaded the project.


Just four weeks and many meetings later, the university’s administration agreed to provide a fully vegan entrée at every meal. The dining service kicked off day one with an all-vegan lunch, where students sampled vegetarian chili, stir-fry, tofu kabobs, hummus, rigatoni and beans, stew, and raspberry sorbet. “There was an overwhelmingly positive student response, even from those who hadn’t tried this way of eating before,” says Jacobi.
Please click here to learn how to veganize your cafeteria.
"
145,Is it OK to patronize restaurants and grocery stores that sell animal products?,"
If we refuse to buy vegetarian food from a supermarket or restaurant that sells or serves meat, the message sent to these businesses is simply one less sale of a vegetarian entrée or item. This translates in their minds as less demand for vegetarian foods, which could result in such offerings being removed from the shelves or menus. That would be very bad, indeed!

It’s also a good rule of thumb to fill out a comment card or thank to the manager whenever you’re impressed with a business’s vegetarian selection.
"
149,Where can I find leather alternatives?,"Nonleather products are readily available. Many department stores and shoe stores offer nonleather shoes, bags, and other products. In fact, many products that look like leather are actually synthetic (pleather). Just check the label for those magic words: “all man-made materials” or “synthetic.”
"
150,What are some alternatives to wool?,"
As the many people who are allergic to wool already know, alternatives to wool clothing and blankets are readily available. Cotton flannel, polyester fleece, and other synthetic fibers wash easily, keep their bright colors, cost less, and don’t contribute to cruelty. "
152,I’ve heard that the Indian leather industry is really cruel. Is it really so bad?,"Since slaughtering cows and buffalos is illegal under most circumstances in all but a few states in India, the cows are marched over hot, dusty roads for 50 to 100 miles, across state lines to locations where they can be loaded onto trucks and taken to slaughter.
 

Typically, up to 24 animals are crammed into trucks meant for only six to seven, so cattle must climb over one another to find any space, inadvertently gouging each other with their horns, trampling and crushing those beneath them. Horns are broken off and nose rings ripped out. Extreme crowding is particularly cruel when temperatures soar, leading to heat exhaustion and suffocation.

 
Many animals are so sick and injured by the time they arrive at the slaughterhouse, they must be dragged inside. Others have hot chili peppers and tobacco rubbed into their eyes and their tail bones painfully twisted and broken just to make them stand up. Some animals have their legs cut off or are skinned while still alive."
153,How is down obtained?,"Typically, ducks and geese are lifted by their necks, their legs tied, and their feathers are ripped out. The struggling birds often sustain injuries during plucking. They are then returned to their cage until they are ready to be plucked again. This process begins when the animals are 8 weeks old and is repeated at eight-week intervals until the birds are slaughtered.


Feathers are often plucked out of ducks and geese raised for food. Those raised for foie gras, especially, suffer terribly. They are force-fed—a funnel is inserted into each bird’s throat, and up to 6 pounds of a salty, fatty corn mash is pumped into the stomach each day—until the bird’s liver has ballooned to four times the normal size.


Synthetic alternatives to down are not only cruelty-free, they are also cheaper and, unlike down, retain their insulating capabilities in all weather conditions. For more information, see PETA’s factsheet on down.
"
154,My school is planning a donkey basketball game to raise money. Are these games cruel to the donkeys?,"Animals do not comprehend or willingly participate in sporting events. Yet donkeys are often prodded around school gymnasiums, kicked, whipped, and screamed at by young, impressionable students who are more concerned with winning the game and showing off for their friends then with the animals’ well-being.


The donkeys are dragged from school to school and are usually not given food and water beforehand so that they don’t have “accidents” during the games. The deprivation, constant travel, unfamiliar surroundings, loud noise, and rough handling are extremely stressful for the donkeys. They often develop unpredictable temperaments and have been known to lash out in frustration or fear, causing injury to participants or bystanders. 


The games may desensitize young people to animal suffering and teach them that we have the right to abuse animals for our own entertainment. Animals should not have to pay the price at school fundraisers. There are countless humane and fun ways to raise school funds. After all, what kid doesn’t love dunking the science teacher or pieing the principal?
 
"
157,Is there any reason I shouldn’t buy a pearl necklace?,"
A pearl is an ulcer that is formed when an irritant, such as a parasite, enters an oyster, who responds by coating it with nacre (a crystalline substance that gives pearls their luster). Stress is what prompts an oyster to secrete nacre (just like stress creates human ulcers).


Because pearls naturally form in only one in 10,000 oysters and because the creation of a pearl can take up to three years, pearl-makers have devised a process called “culturing,” or cultivating, that allows them to exploit oysters faster and cheaper.
Culturing involves surgically opening each oyster shell and inserting an irritant in the oyster. Freshwater pearls are cultured by inserting another oyster’s mantle tissue. Saltwater pearls have beads and another oyster’s mollusk tissue inserted. Fewer than half of the oysters may survive this process.


Cultivators further stress the oysters by suspending them in water in a cage, washing their shells, moving them around in different waters, and raising and lowering their cages to subject them to changing water temperatures. 
After the pearls are extracted from the oysters, one-third of oysters are “recycled” and put through the culturing process again. The others are killed and discarded.
For those concerned about the environment, there is another reason to avoid pearls. Aquaculture has contributed to destruction of natural pearl oyster beds from pollution and overharvesting.
Of course, with so many modern pearl imitations, as well as other kinds of jewelry, it’s easy to do without pearls.
"
158,God put animals here for us to use; the Bible gives us dominion over animals.,"
Dominion is not the same as tyranny. The queen of England has “dominion” over her subjects, but that doesn’t mean she can eat them, wear them, or experiment on them. If we have dominion over animals, surely it is to protect them, not to abuse them for our own ends. 


There is nothing in the Bible that would justify our modern-day policies that desecrate the environment, destroy entire species of wildlife, and inflict torment and death on billions of animals every year. The Bible imparts a reverence for life; a loving God could not help but be appalled at the way His creatures are being treated. For more information, please visit JesusVeg.com.

160,"What about all the customs, traditions, and jobs that depend on using animals?","
The invention of the automobile, the abolition of slavery, and the end of World War II also necessitated job retraining and restructuring. This is simply an ingredient in all social progress—not a reason to deter progress.
"
161,Wasn’t Hitler in favor of animal rights?,"
Contrary to myth, Hitler wasn’t a vegetarian. Although the Nazis purported to pass an anti-vivisection bill, they did not. 


In fact, they were required by law to first perform their experiments on animals before carrying them out on humans. Experiments on humans did not replace animal experiments; on the contrary, animal experiments made them possible. John Vyvyan, in The Dark Face of Science, summed it up this way: “The experiments made on prisoners were many and diverse, but they had one thing in common: All were in continuation of or complementary to experiments on animals. In every instance, this antecedent scientific literature is mentioned in the evidence; and at Buchenwald and Auschwitz concentration camps, human and animal experiments were carried out simultaneously as parts of a single programme.” 


However, even if this weren’t the case, the merits of an idea cannot be determined by the character of its proponents. If Hitler believed in the theory of relativity, does that mean we should not believe in it? What if Gandhi also believed in the theory of relativity—how would we reconcile the two? An idea must be judged on its own merits.
"
162,What about people who have to hunt to survive?,"
We have no quarrel with aboriginal subsistence hunters and fishers who truly have no choice in order to survive. However, in this day and age, meat, fur, and leather are not a necessary part of survival for the vast majority of us.
"
163,Isn’t hunting okay as long as I eat what I kill?,"Did the fact that Jeffrey Dahmer ate his victims justify his crimes? What is done with the corpse after a murder doesn’t lessen the victim’s suffering. Furthermore, hunters are harming animals other than the ones they kill and take home. Those who don’t die outright often suffer disabling injuries. 


Additionally, the stress that hunting inflicts on animals—the noise, the fear, and the constant chase—severely restricts their ability to eat adequately and to store the fat and energy they need to survive the winter. Hunting also disrupts migration and hibernation. For animals like wolves, who mate for life and have close-knit families, hunting can severely harm entire communities.
"
164,"It’s fine for you to believe in animal rights, but you shouldn’t tell other people what to do.","
Hey, now you are telling me what to do! Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but freedom of thought does not always imply freedom of action. You are free to believe whatever you want as long as you don’t hurt others. You may believe that animals should be killed, that black people should be enslaved, or that women should be beaten, but you don’t always have the right to put your beliefs into practice. 


As for telling people what to do, society exists because there are rules governing people’s behavior.
The very nature of reform movements is to “tell others what to do”—don’t use humans as slaves, don’t sexually harass women, etc.—and all movements initially encounter opposition from people who want to go on doing the criticized behavior.
"
167,What is veganism's stance on abortion?,"
Vegans does not have a position on the abortion issue, because our focus as a movement is the alleviation of the suffering inflicted on nonhuman animals. There are people on both sides of the abortion issue in the animal rights movement, just as there are people on both sides of animal rights issues in the pro-life movement. And just as the pro-life movement has no official position on animal rights, neither does the animal rights movement have an official position on abortion.
"
169,What is veganism's stance on gun control?,"
The only position vegans have on guns is that they should not be used to hunt animals. Vegans have objected to some of the National Rifle Association’s positions in the past, because it frequently takes pro-hunting stands and lobbies against bills that would restrict or ban hunting. However, our disagreement with the organization is limited to hunting issues and doesn’t extend to gun control or gun ownership issues.
"
171,Is it OK to eat roadkill?,"If people must eat animal carcasses, roadkill is a superior option to the neatly shrink-wrapped plastic packages of meat in the supermarket.


Eating roadkill is healthier for the consumer than meat laden with antibiotics, hormones, and growth stimulants, as most meat is today. It is also more humane in that animals killed on the road were not castrated, dehorned, or debeaked without anesthesia, did not suffer the trauma and misery of transportation in a crowded truck in all weather extremes, and did not hear the screams and smell the fear of the animals ahead of them on the slaughter line. Perhaps the animals never knew what hit them.

"
173,Where do zoos get their animals?,"Zoos breed their animals or acquire them from other zoos. 

Babies are great crowd-pleasers, but when the babies grow up, they don’t attract the same number of people, so zoos often sell them off in order to make room for younger animals. The unwanted adult animals are sometimes sold to “game” farms where hunters pay to kill them; some are killed for their meat and/or hides. Other “surplus” animals may be sold to smaller, more poorly run zoos or, worse, to laboratories for experiments."
174,"If animals aren’t meant to be eaten, why are they made of meat?","Perhaps a more appropriate question would be: If humans have hearts and brains, why don’t we use them? Because if we did, we would see that animals aren’t so very different from us. They clearly show affection, fear, joy, the desire to live, and more. They aren’t emotion-less machines whose lives are inconvenient stages on the way to our dinner table. 


They are living, breathing, feeling beings who want to lead their own lives just as people do. Once we recognize this, then it’s easy to turn to a diet free of decaying bits of corpses.

It’s also just plain old good sense to reject a cholesterol-laden diet linked to heart disease, stroke, and many cancers and switch to healthier, delicious veggies, grains, fruits, and legumes. Please request a free copy of PETA’s vegetarian starter kit.
"
175,"I used to like to visit animals at the zoo, but they seem so sad. How do vegans feel about zoos?","Zoo officials often consider profits ahead of the animals’ well-being. A former director of the Atlanta Zoo once remarked that he was “too far removed from the animals; they’re the last thing I worry about with all the other problems.” Zoos teach people that it is acceptable to keep animals in captivity, bored, cramped, lonely, far from their natural homes, and at the mercy and whim of people.


Zoos claim to educate people, but most zoo enclosures are quite small, and labels provide little more information than the species’ name, diet, and natural range. The animals’ normal behavior is seldom discussed, much less observed, because their natural needs are seldom met in the zoo environment. 

The many animals who naturally live in large herds or family groups are often kept alone or, at most, in pairs. Natural hunting and mating behaviors are virtually eliminated by regulated feeding and breeding regimens. The animals are closely confined, lack privacy, and have little opportunity for mental stimulation or physical exercise, resulting in abnormal and self-destructive behavior, called zoochosis. Not only is this not educational, we believe a true desire to learn about animals should be motivated by and in keeping with a genuine interest in the animals’ well-being.
"
176,Why should we worry about animals when there are so many problems involving humans?,"There are very serious problems in the world that deserve our attention; but these issues do not diminish the urgency of our cause or any other.


As vegetarians, we advocate eating lower on the food chain, which not only would save 9 billion animals from slaughter each year, but also would save humans from a diet known to cause heart disease, cancer, and obesity. 

Instead of feeding grain to livestock, a plant-based diet makes 16 times more grain available to hungry people. Eliminating intensive factory farming of animals would save precious water and topsoil; in addition, without the ozone-damaging nitrates resulting from billions of pounds of manure, our air would be cleaner and we would take a giant step toward fighting global warming. In this way, animals, humans, and the environment are interconnected—we all stand to gain by not harming animals."
178,Hunting is much less cruel than factory farming.,"Yes, and Jack the Ripper was less cruel than Hitler—that didn’t make him a nice guy. It is true that killing an animal in the wild is less cruel than the months of torture animals endure on factory farms. However, hunting, like farming, disrupts families and causes pain, trauma, and grief to both the victims and the survivors. Why cause any suffering when we can avoid it?
"
179,"Most animals used for food, fur, or experiments are bred for that purpose.","
Unfortunately, somebody forgot to tell the animals that! They insist on behaving as if their lives were important to them, and nobody else. Breeding animals for certain purposes may help us feel better about mistreating them, but it doesn’t change the animals’ biological ability to feel pain and fear.
"
180,What’s wrong with drinking milk? Don’t dairy cows need to be milked?,"In order for a cow to produce milk, she must have a calf. “Dairy” cows are impregnated every year in order to keep up a steady supply of milk. In the natural order of things, the cow’s calf would drink her milk (eliminating her need to milked by humans). But dairy cows’ babies are taken away within a day or two of birth so that humans can have the milk that nature intended for their calves. 

Female dairy calves may be slaughtered immediately or raised to be future dairy cows. Male dairy calves are confined for 16 weeks to tiny veal crates too small for them even to turn around in so that their flesh, sold as veal, will be atrophied and nonmuscular. Then these weak, 4-month-old youngsters are sent to the slaughterhouse.


The current high demand for dairy products requires that cows be pushed far beyond their natural physical limits, genetically engineered and fed growth hormones in order to produce huge quantities of milk. Even the few farmers who choose not to raise animals intensively must both eliminate the calf (who would otherwise drink the milk) and send the mother to an early death when her milk production wanes. 
"
181,My friend has chickens and they’re treated very well. Is it ok to eat their eggs?,"If you have a close friend or family member who keeps rescued chickens as companions and doesn’t breed or sell them or their eggs, and whose home you have visited personally to ensure the birds’ welfare, then you are not hurting the chickens by eating the eggs that the birds lay naturally. 


However, it would greatly help other chickens if the eggs were given to people who would otherwise consume eggs from factory-farmed birds.


Of course, the healthiest choice is to avoid all eggs—and it’s easy, too! "
184,Is it OK for vegetarians to eat shrimp?,"There are certain creatures—like scallops, oysters, and shrimp—that we just don’t know a whole lot about. We aren’t sure how much pain and suffering they are capable of feeling. Here at PETA, we urge people to “err on the side of compassion.” Since we don’t know for sure that these creatures can’t suffer, we opt to assume they do and act accordingly.


An equally pressing reason to avoid sea “food” of all kinds is the issue of bycatch. When fishers seek a certain quarry, they often injure and kill other sea creatures in the process. In the case of shrimp, sea turtles are often caught and killed in the shrimp nets. This is a huge contributor to the decline in the sea turtle population.


Another reason to avoid eating sea creatures of any kind is the fact that fishing has had a devastating effect on the world’s oceans. This means that food is scarce not only for humans, but also for the other animals, such as seals, dolphins, and sea birds, who survive on what they catch in the sea. When we catch huge quantities of sea creatures, we reduce the food source for these animals, who, unlike most humans, truly must consume fish and other sea creatures in order to survive.
"
186,What’s Wrong With Crating Dogs and Puppies?,"Most people don’t realize that animals who are caged for extended periods of time often become aggressive, withdrawn, hyperactive, and/or severely depressed, and they can also develop other problems, such as eating disorders. Crating for extended periods of time prevents dogs from fulfilling some of their most basic needs, including walking around, relieving themselves, and stretching.


There are numerous humane alternatives to crating for people whose schedules force them to leave their canine companions at home during the workday, including humane training, which teaches guardians effective ways to communicate with their animal companions. It is also vital that dogs get plenty of exercise, preferably in the morning (at least 45 minutes for a young dog)—tired dogs want to sleep, not “redecorate” the living room. Dogs should get at least one long walk every day, as well as several shorter walks and vigorous play sessions.
"
187,Does eating meat really cause impotence?,"Medical evidence indicates that meat-eating does indeed cause impotence, because meat clogs up the arteries going to all organs, not just to the heart. 

Meat-eating is also linked to numerous other health problems, including heart disease, cancer, and stroke. But it seems that many men care more about their virility than their longevity, so we’re appealing to them on their terms."
188,"I love seeing the animals at the circus, and they don’t seem to mind performing. Why do vegans protest the use of animals in circuses?","According to Ringling Bros. founder Henry Ringling North, in his book, The Circus Kings, tigers and lions are “chained to their pedestals, and ropes are put around their necks to choke them down. They work from fear.” He also writes that trainers commonly break bears’ noses or burn their paws to force them to stand on their hind legs, that lions and tigers are routinely choked with ropes to make them behave, and that monkeys and chimpanzees are struck with trainers’ clubs while they scream.


The fact is, animals do not naturally ride bicycles, stand on their heads, balance on balls, or jump through rings of fire. To force them to perform these confusing and physically uncomfortable tricks, trainers use whips, tight collars, muzzles, electric prods, bullhooks, and other painful tools of the trade.


We applaud the trapeze artists, jugglers, clowns, tightrope-walkers, and acrobats, but let’s leave the animals in peace. Sweden, Denmark, Finland, India, and the U.K. have all banned or restricted the use of animals in entertainment—it’s time for the U.S. to do the same.

"
190,"Animals don’t reason, don’t understand rights, and don’t always respect our rights, so why should we apply our ideas of morality to them?","
An animal’s inability to understand and adhere to our rules is as irrelevant as a child’s or a person with a developmental disability’s inability to do so. Like small children, most animals are not capable of choosing to change their behavior, but adult human beings have the intelligence to choose between behavior that hurts others and behavior that doesn’t.
"
192,Don’t zoos help to preserve endangered species?,"Most animals confined in zoos are not endangered, nor are they being prepared for release into natural habitats. In fact, it is nearly impossible to release captive-bred animals, including threatened species like elephants, polar bears, gorillas, tigers and chimpanzees into the wild. Zoos aren’t breeding animals with the intent of replenishing threatened populations: Babies bring visitors through the gates, and captive breeding gives the public a false sense of security about a species’ survival. But that belief undermines support for and diverts resources from in-situ conservation efforts.


A 2015 study published in the Journal of Applied Ecology concluded that unless animals in the wild are protected, captive breeding won’t make a difference.
Lead researcher Dr Paul Dolman said: “Our research challenges the assumption that when a species is perilously close to extinction in the wild, it is always a good idea to set up a captive breeding population … Without conservation in the wild there is no point in captive breeding.”"
194,Farmers have to treat their animals well or they won’t produce as much milk or lay as many eggs.,"Animals on factory farms do not gain weight, lay eggs, and produce milk because they are comfortable, content, or well cared for but, rather, because they have been manipulated specifically to do these things through genetics, medications, hormones, and management techniques. 

In addition, animals raised for food today are slaughtered at extremely young ages, usually before disease and misery have decimated them.


Such huge numbers of animals are raised for food that it is less expensive for farmers to absorb some losses than it is to provide humane conditions."
196,"It’s almost impossible to avoid using all animal products; if you’re still causing animal suffering without realizing it, what’s the point?","
It is impossible to live your life without causing some harm; we’ve all accidentally stepped on ants or breathed in gnats, but that doesn’t mean we should intentionally cause unnecessary harm. Just because you might accidentally hit someone with your car is no reason to run someone over on purpose.
"
197,Can I get enough protein as a vegan?,"A wealth of evidence shows that vegans need not worry about getting enough protein; if you eat a reasonably varied diet and sufficient calories, you will undoubtedly get enough protein. The average person who eats animal products eats about double the protein that his or her body needs, and there is medical evidence to show that eating too much protein can lead to serious health problems. In addition, unlike animal products, vegan foods have absolutely no cholesterol and hardly any saturated fat.
"
198,What about insects and other “pests”?,All animals have feelings and have a right to live free from unnecessary suffering—regardless of whether they are considered “pests” or “ugly.”
199,Can shellfish feel pain?,"
Yes. Scientists have proved beyond a doubt that fish, lobsters, crabs, and other sea dwellers feel pain. Lobsters’ bodies are covered with chemoreceptors so they are very sensitive to their environments. Boiling lobsters alive is particularly cruel. 

A lobster’s ideal body temperature is between 38 and 42 degrees Fahrenheit; when lobsters are packed on ice, they sometimes “drop” a claw in order to conserve body heat. 

As many people have discovered, when dropped into boiling water, lobsters will frantically scrape the sides of the pot in a futile attempt to escape. 

If grocery stores kept live pigs or chickens crammed together in filthy glass tanks with accompanying recipes suggesting that the animals be dropped into a pot of scalding water, consumers would be outraged. These acts are equally deserving of outrage when perpetrated on shellfish.
"
200,Don’t scientists care about the animals they experiment on? Doesn’t their research depend on the animals’ well-being?,"Investigations at even the most prestigious institutions show that this is simply not the case. At the City of Hope in California, one of the country’s most prominent research facilities, animals starved to death and drowned in their own feces. Many experimenters become calloused after years of research and don’t see the animals’ suffering. 


They treat animals like disposable tools and consider proper animal care to be too expensive.
"
201,What’s wrong with the rodeo?,"Rodeo performers have been documented beating, kicking, and shocking normally docile cows and horses in chutes and holding pens. “Bucking broncos” and steers are provoked with electric prods, sharp sticks, caustic ointments, and the pinching “bucking” strap. 


By the time the animals are released into the arena, they are frantic. Calves, roped when running, have their necks snapped back by the lasso, often resulting in neck and back injuries, bruises, broken bones, and internal bleeding.


After their short and painful “careers,” animals in rodeos are sent to the slaughterhouse. Dr. C.G. Haber, a veterinarian who spent 30 years as a federal meat inspector, describes the animals discarded from rodeos for slaughter as being “so extensively bruised that the only areas in which the skin was attached [to the flesh] was the head, neck, leg, and belly. I have seen animals with six to eight ribs broken from the spine and, at times, puncturing the lungs. I have seen as much as 2 to 3 gallons of free blood accumulated under the detached skin.”"
202,"Why shouldn’t people drink milk and eat dairy products? Cows don’t need to be killed to produce milk, right?","At least 5 million cows raised for milk in the United States live on factory farms under conditions that cause them tremendous suffering. They do not graze contentedly in fields; they live in cramped, concrete-floored milking pens where they are milked by machines that often cause cuts and injuries that would not occur if people did the milking.


In addition, while many consumers have heard about the cruelty of the veal industry, most people don’t know that the dairy and veal industries are inextricably linked. Cows, like humans, only give milk after they’ve had a baby. Thus, in the eyes of the farmer, the cows’ offspring are simply a byproduct of this milk-production cycle. Perhaps the greatest pain suffered by cows in the dairy industry is the repeated loss of their young, which is quite traumatic to these extremely maternal animals. Female calves may join the ranks of the milk producers, but the males are generally taken from their mothers within 24 hours of birth and sold at auction either for the notorious veal industry or to beef producers.


Within 60 days, the cow will be impregnated again. For about seven months of her next nine-month pregnancy, the cow will continue to be milked for the fluid meant for her older calf—and this cycle is repeated until her milk production wanes, at which time she is sent to slaughter, most likely to be ground up into fast-food burgers. Calves will continue to suffer as long as there is a market for dairy products.

204,"Do candles contain animal-derived ingredients, and if so, are there alternatives?","It is possible for candles to contain beeswax or animal-derived stearic acid, but there are several alternatives. The following companies sell vegan candles.  "
205,What do vegans eat?,"Vegan diets tend to be more colorful and varied than meat-based diets—vegans can enjoy just about every dish a meat-eater can by cooking with veggie burgers, “ham,” “hot dogs,” and “turkey” made out of soy and with less familiar staples such as tofu, tempeh, textured vegetable protein (TVP), and seitan. These can be added to spaghetti, soups, salads, lasagna, stir-fries, and chili.


Many vegans take advantage of delicious ethnic cuisine, such as Chinese, Indian, Thai, and Mexican, and convenience foods, such as instant soup, frozen “TV dinners,” flavored rice mixes, and canned soup (many black bean, minestrone, and vegetable varieties are vegan).


Vegans eat baked and refried beans and pizza without cheese but piled high with vegetable toppings like peppers, mushrooms, or even artichokes or pineapple. Vegans bake with egg replacers, soy flour, and mashed tofu."
207,What’s wrong with wearing leather? Aren’t the cows going to be slaughtered for meat anyway?,"This is a common misconception concerning leather. The animal’s skin is the most economically important coproduct of the meatpacking industry.


When dairy cows’ production declines, for example, their skin is made into leather; the hides of their offspring, “veal” calves, are made into high-priced calfskin. 


Thus, the economic success of the slaughterhouse (and the factory farm) is directly linked to the sale of leather goods. Decreasing demand for both animal foods and leather products will result in fewer cows being factory-farmed and killed. There are so many alternatives to leather, why support unnecessary cruelty?
"
209,What do you mean by “animal rights”?,"Animal rights means that animals deserve certain kinds of consideration—consideration of what is in their best interests, regardless of whether they are “cute,” useful to humans, or an endangered species and regardless of whether any human cares about them at all. It means recognizing that animals are not ours to use—for food, clothing, entertainment, or experimentation.
"
210,Is there a humane way to get rid of mice and rats?,"There’s a humane way to do anything! According to Dr. David E. Davis of Johns Hopkins University, “Poisons or traps merely make space for more rats to grow.” To prevent a rat or mouse problem, take away what makes your home attractive to them: food and shelter. Start by making sure that there is no food in open places or in cardboard containers, which rats can eat right through. Keep garbage in tightly covered containers. 


Next, deny them a way to enter your home by sealing holes at the bottom of walls. Of course, this means that while no rats can come in, any who are already inside can’t get out. If rats are already inside, you will need to set a trap—but be careful which one you pick. Glue traps, flat boxes with adhesive to trap rodents, should be avoided at all costs. 
"
211,Has animal experimentation advanced our knowledge of cancer?,"The New England Journal of Medicine has declared that 20 years of fighting cancer have been unsuccessful in significantly reducing the death rates from the disease. Despite a two-decade-long war on the disease, cancer remains our number two killer. Those who line their pockets with animals’ suffering are full of dire predictions that medical research will screech to a halt if we stop experimenting on animals. But animal experiments hurt humans as well as the animals who are burned, shocked, starved, cut open, and killed. While people and animals suffer alike, physiologically, different species vary so vastly that data can’t be accurately extrapolated from one species to another. Even chimpanzees, our closest living relatives—with whom we share 99 percent of our DNA—don’t sicken when infected with many diseases that are fatal to us.


Alternatives to animal tests are efficient and reliable and, in most cases, take less time to complete, cost only a fraction of the animal experiments they replace, and are not plagued with species differences that make extrapolation difficult or impossible. Today’s most forward-thinking scientists realize that we don’t need to choose between human health and compassion for animals.
"
212,Is it OK to declaw cats?,"If you asked your cat if it would be okay to put her through 10 separate, painful amputations that would weaken her legs, shoulders, and back muscles, she would probably say “no”—and she wouldn’t be alone. Many veterinarians in the U.S. and abroad absolutely refuse to declaw cats. 

In fact, in Germany and some other parts of Europe, declawing is illegal. Cats who have been declawed experience extreme pain when coming out of anesthesia and have difficulty walking until their paws heal. Without their claws, cats are virtually defenseless, and this can lead to neurosis and even skin and bladder problems.
Cats can easily be taught not to scratch furniture with the aid of a scratching post and firm, consistent instructions on where they may and may not scratch. To learn more, please visit  PETA’s declawing factsheet.
"
213,I have heard that ketchup contains animal blood and/or other animal-derived ingredients. Is this true?,"We have never encountered information that indicates that ketchup contains blood or any other animal-derived ingredient. It is possible that the “natural flavors” in the list of ingredients could be animal-derived. Contact the manufacturer of the brand that you are interested in to inquire about the source of the natural flavors. Organic ketchups are likely to be free of additives that may contain animal-derived products.


According to the Heinz Web site (under “Heinz Products”) “Heinz ketchup has never contained any animal products.” The site goes on to say that “the FDA has set a standard of identity for ketchup that does not permit the use of any animal products. Any deviation from this standard of identity would mean that the product could no longer be called ketchup [or be] sold legally under the name ketchup.”
"
214,"If everyone switches to vegetables and grains, will there be enough to eat?","Yes. We feed so much grain to animals in order to fatten them up for consumption that if we all became vegetarians, we could produce enough food to feed the entire world. In the U.S., animals are fed more than 80 percent of the corn we grow and more than 95 percent of the oats. The world’s cattle alone consume a quantity of food equal to the caloric needs of 8.7 billion people—more than the entire human population on Earth. Click here for more on meat and the environment.
"
215,What are some alternatives to eggs?,"Often, one egg in a recipe can simply be skipped, but there are also many tried and true substitutes that work wonders:
Crumbled and seasoned tofu makes delicious morning scrambles and eggless salad. Also, look for eggless mayonnaise, scrambled-tofu mixes, and other egg alternatives in your local health food store. Be aware that Egg Beaters, sold in many supermarkets, are made with egg whites, meaning that twice as many eggs are used in their production since the yolks are discarded.


Instead of using an egg for binding burgers and loaves, try mashed potato, mashed avocado, moistened bread crumbs, or rolled oats. For baking, try the following (each substitute replaces one egg):
Commercial egg replacer (this is a powder sold in boxes at most health food stores) 3 Tbsp. silken tofu blended with the liquid in the recipe2 Tbsp. cornstarch, potato starch, or arrowroot mixed with 2 Tbsp. water 1 heaping Tbsp. soy flour + 2 Tbsp. water 1/2 banana, mashed 1 Tbsp. flax seeds + 1/2 cup water blended for 1 to 2 minutes or until the mixture is thick and has the consistency of beaten egg whites
"
216,Animals are not as intelligent or advanced as humans.,"
If having superior intelligence does not entitle one human to abuse another human for his or her purposes, why should it entitle humans to abuse nonhumans?


There are animals who are unquestionably more intelligent, creative, aware, communicative, and able to use language than some humans, as in the case of a chimpanzee compared to a human infant or a person with a severe developmental disability, for example. 


Should the more intelligent animals have rights and the less intelligent humans be denied rights? Nineteenth-century philosopher Jeremy Bentham wrote, “The question is not, can they reason? Nor, can they talk? But can they suffer?” The measure of who deserves protection is not intelligence, it is the capacity to feel pain.
"
218,I recently became a vegetarian and will no longer buy leather. Does that mean I should get rid of all the leather products that I already own?,"This is a tough question because, on the one hand, you don’t want to send a silent message that these products are acceptable by wearing them. 


On the other hand, not all of us have the luxury of being able to throw out lots of our old clothes in order to buy an entirely new (cruelty-free) wardrobe! 
"
219,What is the difference between “animal rights” and “animal welfare”?,"
Animal welfare theories accept that animals have interests but allow these interests to be traded away as long as there are some human benefits that are thought to justify that sacrifice.


Animal rights means that animals, like humans, have interests that cannot be sacrificed or traded away just because it might benefit others. However, the rights position does not hold that rights are absolute; an animal’s rights, just like those of humans, must be limited, and rights can certainly conflict. Animal rights means that animals are not ours to use for food, clothing, entertainment, or experimentation. Animal welfare allows these uses as long as “humane” guidelines are followed.
"
220,Is the fur industry really as cruel as people make it out to be?,"Crueler. 

Animals caught in steel-jaw traps are in so much pain that some actually bite off their limbs in order to escape. Unable to eat, keep warm, or defend themselves against predators, many die horrible deaths before the trapper arrives to kill them. Others suffer in the traps for days until they are caught and killed. 


To avoid damaging the pelt, trappers often beat or stomp the animals to death. Most states have no regulations regarding methods of slaughtering these animals.
Whether enduring the excruciating pain of a steel-jaw traps or a lifetime of agony in a tiny cage, the animals suffer immensely.

221,Hunting fees are a major source of revenue for wildlife management and habitat restoration.,"The relatively small fee each hunter pays does not cover the cost of hunting programs or game warden salaries. Hunting fees pay for hunter programs that benefit only hunters, like manipulating animal populations to increase the number of animals available to kill. The public lands that many hunters use are supported by taxpayers, and funds benefiting “nongame” species are scarce.

223,What’s wrong with beeswax?,"Beeswax, found in some lipsticks and other cosmetics, is obtained by melting a honeycomb with boiling water and then straining and cooling it.


It is not unusual for farmers at larger bee farms to cut off the queen bee’s wings so that she cannot leave the colony or to have her artificially inseminated on a bee-sized version of the factory-farm “rape rack.” When the beekeeper wants to move a queen to a new colony, she is carried with “bodyguard” bees, all of whom—if they survive transport—will be killed by the bees in the new colony. Large commercial bee farms may also replace the honey—which bees produce and need to get through the winter—with a cheap sugar substitute that lacks the nutrition of honey."
224,What rights should animals have?,"
Animals have the right to equal consideration of their interests. For instance, a dog most certainly has an interest in not having pain inflicted on him or her unnecessarily. We therefore are obliged to take that interest into consideration and to respect the dog’s right not to have pain unnecessarily inflicted upon him or her. 


However, animals don’t always have the same rights as humans, because their interests are not always the same as ours and some rights would be irrelevant to animals’ lives. For instance, a dog doesn’t have an interest in voting and therefore doesn’t have the right to vote, since that right would be as meaningless to a dog as it is to a child.

225,What’s wrong with silk?,"Silk is the fiber that silkworms weave to make cocoons. To obtain silk, distributors boil the worms alive inside their cocoons. Anyone who has ever seen worms startle when their dark homes are uncovered must acknowledge that worms are sensate—they produce endorphins and have a physical response to pain. 


Humane alternatives to silk—including nylon, milkweed seed pod fibers, silk-cotton tree and ceiba tree filaments, polyester, and rayon—are easy to find and usually less expensive, too. Click here to read PETA’s “Down and Silk: Birds and Insects Exploited for Fabric” factsheet.
"
226,But don’t cows need to be milked?,"Cows—like all mammals—need to become pregnant in order to produce milk. “Dairy” cows are impregnated every year so that they will produce a steady supply of milk. Whereas in nature, the baby drinks the milk that the mother produces, humans take the calf away from the mother cow and drink the milk intended for her baby. Cows wouldn’t need to be milked if we didn’t take their calves away from them or impregnate them in the first place. 
"
227,How do circuses train animals?,"Joel Parrott, executive director of the Oakland Zoo, testified before Congress that training “can be severe, using techniques that include prolonged hitting by the elephant trainer with clubs, stabbing with the point of the ankus, pitchforks, electricity, electric prods, prolonged chaining, and food deprivation.”


Tigers and lions spend most of their lives in cramped transport cages, barely able to take a step in any direction. They learn to fear the whip and often cringe and cower as trainers approach. Elephant babies, ripped from their mothers’ sides, perform under threat of punishment night after night, eyes always riveted on the person with the metal hook or the whip.


Circuses that exploit animals have no place in a compassionate society. It’s time for all of us to stop patronizing animal circuses—and to demand that the animal performers be sent to sanctuaries, where they can live out their lives in dignity. For more information, please click here.

229,I heard that some vegetarians sued McDonald’s for using beef flavoring in its French fries. Who won?,"McDonald’s got into hot water with vegetarians when it advertised that its fries were cooked in vegetable oil, but didn’t readily disclose that the fries were flavored with beef tallow.


McDonald’s was sued by several vegetarians and Hindus who do not eat meat for ethical and/or religious reasons. McDonald’s agreed to issue an apology and pay $10 million to vegetarian and religious groups. While the French fries still contain beef flavoring at this time, we’re hopeful that the lawsuit will help persuade McDonald’s to remove it.

231,"I’d like to write a letter to my local paper regarding a terrible story they printed, but I’m not much of a writer. Is there anything I should know?","Newspapers, magazines, and radio and television stations, just like other businesses, value feedback from their readers, listeners, and viewers. Whereas letters from a national organization are sometimes perceived as an interest group “just doing its job,” letters from readers and listeners in the community can be much more effective.


Editors are not so concerned about perfect writing skills; they’re concerned about your opinions. Writing letters to the editor—and to businesses and lawmakers—is a great way of getting the message out.

234,How do I report animal cruelty?," 
Witnessing animal abuse can be very traumatic, especially if you aren’t sure what to do about it. The most important steps are to become familiar with your local animal cruelty laws, find out which agency handles cruelty complaints, and learn how to follow up to make sure an investigation is conducted.

"
235,Is it all right to buy my new puppy from a pet store?,"Many dogs sold in pet shops come from puppy mills and breeding kennels found mostly in the Midwest. In puppy mills, female dogs are kept in crude, outdoor cages without protection from rain, sweltering heat, bitter cold, and biting wind. Denied companionship and comfort, they are treated like breeding machines. Their puppies are taken from them at an early age, packed into crates, and shipped hundreds of miles to dealers, often without adequate food, water, or ventilation. Poor breeding practices lead to numerous health problems, including distemper, parvovirus, respiratory conditions, physical deformities, deafness, eye diseases, and a host of other ailments.


Once the puppies get to the pet store, life in cramped cages adds more strain to their already stressed lives, increasing their susceptibility to disease. No law regulates how pet shops dispose of their animals, and some stores have been caught killing unsold dogs on the premises and throwing them into trash Dumpsters. Breeders churn out countless numbers of puppies each year, while millions of dogs are killed for want of a good home. Dogs are dumped at local pounds or abandoned in the woods and on city streets. Animal shelters can place only a fraction of the animals they receive, and the rest must be put to death. Because of this overpopulation crisis, no breeding can be considered “responsible.”


If you have the time, energy, space, and money to care for a dog (or two), please visit your local animal shelter and adopt.
"
238,Why blame me? I didn’t kill the animal.,"No, but you hired the killer. Whenever you purchase meat, that means the killing was done for you and you paid for it.

"
239,Don’t humans have to eat meat to stay healthy?,"Both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the American Dietetic Association have endorsed vegetarian diets. Studies have shown that vegetarians have stronger immune systems than meat-eaters and that meat-eaters are almost twice as likely to die of heart disease, 60 percent more likely to die of cancer, and 30 percent more likely to die of other diseases. 

Consumption of meat and dairy products has been conclusively linked with diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, clogged arteries, obesity, asthma, and impotence."
240,Is commercial fishing bad for the environment?,"Many commercial fishing vessels practice bottom-trawling in order to catch sea animals who live near, on, or under the sea floor, such as flounder, cod, grouper, shrimp, and scallops. Scientists say that the destruction caused by bottom-trawling is similar to that caused by clear-cutting old forests, only on a far greater scale. 

For example, the area of seabed trawled each year is roughly the size of the 48 contiguous states: 150 times greater than the area of forest cut! Elliot Norse, president of the Marine Conservation Biology Institute, says, “Scientists find that bottom-trawling is the largest disturbance to the world’s sea floor and possibly the largest human-caused disturbance to the biosphere.”

241,"If animal exploitation were wrong, it would be illegal.","
Legality is no guarantee of morality. Who does and doesn’t have legal rights is determined merely by the opinion of current legislators. The law changes as public opinion or political motivations change, but ethics are not so arbitrary. Look at some of the other things that have at one time been legal in the U.S.—child labor, human slavery, the oppression of women.
"
243,Is hunting necessary to stop overpopulation of deer and other animals?,"No. Starvation and disease are unfortunate, but they are nature’s way of ensuring that the strong survive. 


Natural predators help keep prey species strong by killing the only ones they can catch—the sick and weak. Hunters, however, kill any animal they come across or any animal whose head they think would look good mounted above the fireplace—often the large, healthy animals needed to keep the population strong. And hunting creates the ideal conditions for overpopulation. 


After hunting season, the abrupt drop in population leads to less competition among survivors, resulting in a higher birth rate. If we were really concerned about keeping animals from starving, we would not hunt but instead take steps to reduce the animals’ fertility. We would also preserve wolves, mountain lions, coyotes, and other natural predators. Ironically, many deer herds and duck populations are purposely manipulated to produce more and more animals for hunters to kill.

"
248,At least the animals on factory farms are fed and protected.,"
This argument was used to claim that black people were better off as slaves on plantations than as free men and women. The same could also be said of people in prison, yet prison is considered one of society’s harshest punishments. Animals on factory farms suffer so much that it is inconceivable that they could be worse off in the wild. The wild isn’t “wild” to the animals who live there; it’s their home. There they have their freedom and can engage in their natural activities. The fact that they might suffer in the wild is no reason to ensure that they suffer in captivity.
"
249,Won’t reducing intensive meat production be sufficient to improve the environment?,"Plainly put, the sheer quantity of animals required to feed people’s taste for meat, dairy products, and eggs makes humane, environmentally responsible practices impossible. Profitability dictates that the meat, dairy, and egg industries crowd the largest number of animals into the smallest space possible, leading to massive water pollution, soil erosion from the amount of crops needed to feed these animals, and other eco-nightmares.

252,"My biggest problem with commercial fishing is all the unintended animals who are caught, killed, and thrown away. That’s not an issue when fish are aquafarmed, though, is it?","Fish-eating birds are drawn to open aquaculture ponds as a source of food. Rather than using nonlethal measures to keep birds from eating the fish, such as netting the ponds, many aquafarmers simply kill the birds. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS), which issues the permits allowing the birds to be killed, has no method in place to ensure that aquafarmers obey the permit limits for numbers and species of birds killed.


When the National Audubon Society investigated aquaculture sites, they found massive burial pits of dead birds—far more than USFWS permits allowed. Nevertheless, distinguishing between intended and unintended victims is arbitrary; animas don’t suffer any less because they get eaten."
253,How can you justify spending your time helping animals when so many humans need help?,"There are many serious problems in our world that deserve our attention; cruelty to animals is one of them.
No one organization can fight all moral and social crimes; for example, the American Heart Association fights heart disease, but not cancer or any other disease. Save the Children helps starving children, but not disabled veterans. Fortunately, PETA’s pro-animal activities have great power to better the human condition as well. As vegetarians, we advocate eating lower on the food chain, which would not only save 25 billion innocent animals from slaughter each year, but would also save humans from a diet known to cause heart disease and cancer.


We can help feed starving children around the world by choosing carefully what we put on our plates. Adhering to a plant-based diet makes 16 times more food available for other hungry people than consuming a meat-eating diet. Eliminating intensive factory farming of animals would also save precious fresh water and topsoil.

"
254,"Why do some product labels say, “No animal ingredients,” when they contain beeswax, lanolin, buttermilk, etc.?","This type of misleading labeling is often caused by a lack of education about animal issues or by insensitivity to the suffering of animals in the production of products that do not involve the actual slaughter of the animal. PETA attempts to educate officials at these companies, but some have persisted in inaccurately labeling their products even though honey, lanolin, buttermilk, etc., are, indeed, animal products. 


We advise you to read the entire label before believing such a statement and to voice your complaints when you find products that are mislabeled.
"
255,"If I stop consuming dairy products, won’t that put me at greater risk for osteoporosis?","High-protein foods, such as meat, eggs, and dairy products, produce poisonous byproducts when they are broken down so the body buffers the toxins with calcium before they are eliminated. This leaches calcium from the body, including from the bones, resulting in a loss that cancels out the dietary intake of calcium from animal products. In countries where dairy products are not generally consumed, there is less osteoporosis than in the United States, where dairy consumption is among the highest in the world."
257,People have always eaten animal products. Why should we stop now?,"Never in human history have people eaten as many animal products as we do now. Today, rich and poor can afford to eat these products, largely as a result of the cost-cutting methods used to raise “food” animals. Present-day factory farms inflict massive, large-scale suffering of a magnitude never before seen in agricultural practices. 


In addition, the human population is larger today than ever before. Billions of people eating meat means that billions of tons of water and grain are being diverted from the world’s poor people and fed to the livestock of the rich; the resultant billions of pounds of manure are destroying our topsoil, drinking water, and ozone layer. 


In addition, today we not only have medical evidence of the health benefits of a plant-based diet, we also have many easily accessible products, such as tofu, tempeh, nondairy milk, yogurt, cheese, and ice cream, and many other healthful and delicious products that make the switch to a vegan diet easy and delicious.

258,How can I help prevent “roadkill”?,"
Defensive driving techniques, such as driving slowly at night, honking your horn at animals who look as if they are about to enter the roadway, or flashing your high beams at animals to break the sometimes hypnotic effect of the glare of the headlights can help. Many people swear by “deer alarms,” small whistles inaudible to human ears that you attach to the front bumper of your car.


Carry an animal rescue kit in your car for stray or injured animals. It should include dog biscuits and cat food (to lure reluctant animals); a long rope or leash that can be looped into a collar to capture dogs and cats; a bandage for a muzzle (an injured dog may snap or bite); a collapsible cardboard cat carrier (for cats, squirrels, turtles, and other small animals); a blanket or towel; a brown paper bag and clothespin to keep it shut (for carrying injured birds), and a list of emergency phone numbers of veterinarians, humane societies, animal shelters, and wildlife rehabilitators.


If you come upon an animal who has been killed by a car, you can either move him or her out of the roadway yourself, or report the incident to the local animal control department who will usually come and pick up the animal.

259,How can vegetarianism be healthy? I know a vegetarian who is unhealthy.,"There are healthy and unhealthy vegetarians. But doctors agree that vegetarians who eat a varied low-fat diet stand a much better chance of living longer, healthier lives than their meat-eating counterparts."
261,How are racehorses usually treated?,"Sadly, for many equine athletes, injury and death are always just a hoofbeat away. A 1993 University of Minnesota study revealed that 840 horses were fatally injured on U.S. tracks in 1992, and 3,566 horses were injured so badly that they could not finish the race. Selective breeding over centuries has made thoroughbreds’ legs far too fragile for their bodies. 


Most thoroughbreds are owned by corporations that have no interest in them aside from making money; such owners don’t hesitate to sell horses to a slaughterhouse “kill buyer” when they break down. First, though, many horses are turned into junkies by their trainers and veterinarians, who provide drugs to keep them racing when they shouldn’t be on the track. Dr. Gregory Ferraro, a former racetrack veterinarian, says that treatments are now often used “to force the animal, like some punch-drunk fighter, to make just one more round.” Horses are forced to run with hairline fractures that would be too painful to run on without drugs.


As an article in Sports Illustrated concluded: “There is much uncertainty about why so many racehorses end up dead on American tracks every year, but the figures are appalling and unacceptable by any humane standard.” To learn more, please read the factsheet about the horse-racing industry
"
262,Do musical instruments utilize animal products?,"Today, very few instruments are made with animal products. Gut strings are the only animal-derived product still commonly used in the creation of musical instruments.


However, even gut strings—most commonly found on very expensive tennis rackets, guitars, violins, and other stringed instruments—can easily be replaced with synthetics like nylon or steel. Almost any music store should be able to accommodate your request for a cruelty-free instrument. Before making a purchase, take the time to verify that the instrument is free of animal products by using the following information as a guide.


Animal Oils, Tallow Some companies advocate the use of lanolin, tallow, or other animal oils to clean drum heads. Vegetable-based oils can easily be used for this purpose.
Animal Skins In the past, animal skins from sheep, elks, and cows were commonly used to make drumheads and traditional bagpipes. Today, most drumheads are made from synthetic materials, and the creators of Gore-tex have developed a synthetic material for use in bagpipes.


Horsehair Violin bows may be made with horsehair, but synthetic vegan options exist.


Piano Keys Piano keys are rarely made from ivory but can be made from the hooves, horns, and bones of a variety of animals. Today, however, many piano makers—including Steinway and Baldwin—use white plastic.
"
263,Is aquaculture bad for the environment?,"Fish farms, or “aquafarms,” discharge waste, pesticides, and other chemicals directly into ecologically fragile coastal waters, destroying local ecosystems. And aquaculture farms that raise fish directly in fenced-in areas of natural waters kill off thriving natural habitats by overloading them far beyond their capacity. 


Waste from the excessive number of fish can cause huge blankets of green slime on the water’s surface, depleting oxygen and killing much of the life in the water. In Brazil, destruction caused by aquaculture changed the local climate so much that some aquaculture operations have been forced to shut down.


Raising 1 ton of fish takes 8 tons of water. Intensive shrimp production takes up to 10 times more water. According to the journal Science, a 2-acre salmon farm produces as much waste as a town of 10,000 people. Salmon farms in British Columbia were found to be producing as much waste as a city of half a million people.


And while aquafarmers like to tout aquaculture as an alternative to depleting wild fish populations, many of the fish species they farm are predators, like salmon and shrimp, and are fed ocean fish. It takes 5 pounds of ocean fish to produce 1 pound of farmed fish.

"
265,What about fish in the wild caught by commercial fishers?,"Today’s commercial fishers use vast trawlers the size of football fields. These huge nets, sometimes miles long, stretch across the ocean, swallowing up everything in their path and killing countless animals in addition to those they are intended to catch. Factory trawlers are emptying the oceans of sea life at an alarming pace. 


Thirteen of the 17 major global fisheries are depleted or in serious decline. The other four are “overexploited” or “fully exploited.” I’ll never forget one fisher who operated a small fishing boat in Washington state. She said to me of an otter who had died in her net that day, “Anything stupid enough to get in my net deserves to die.” Nearly one-third of all species of fish have declined in population in the last 15 years, and many species may be wiped out in the next decade. 


The decline in fish populations is leading to increasing conflicts between fishers and the wildlife who eat fish. Some fishers intentionally kill or maim seals, birds, and marine mammals whom they perceive as a threat to their catch. Some species are in decline as a result of fishing. The number of Steller’s sea lions in the Bering Sea has declined by 80 percent since the 1950s. An estimated 100,000 seals, whales, and porpoises and a million birds every year become entangled in nets and drown. Because dolphins habitually swim with schools of tuna, the tuna fishing industry even today “accidentally” drowns at least 20,000 of these intelligent mammals annually. Critically endangered sea turtles have been killed incidentally by the thousands by shrimp trawlers. Eating one fish results in the deaths of many.

266,Vegan options are more expensive than their nonvegetarian counterparts. Can I afford to go vegan?,"You’re right that vegan specialty foods, like prepared veggie burgers, etc., are sometimes more expensive than their nonvegan counterparts, but fortunately, they aren’t the only options. Prepared food will always be more expensive than food you make yourself, so buying the ingredients and making them at home will typically save you money. 


Veggie staples such as pasta, rice, tofu, and beans are much cheaper than meat. The money you save from not buying meat can go toward paying just a little extra for nondairy milk and other staples, like fruits and vegetables. Another suggestion is to buy food in bulk, either at the store, over the Internet, or through catalogs. "
268,Do vegetarians have difficulty getting enough protein?,"In the West, our problem is that we get too much protein, not too little. Most Americans get about seven times as much protein as they need. You can get enough protein from whole wheat bread, oatmeal, beans, corn, peas, mushrooms, or broccoli—almost every food contains protein. 


Junk food aside, it’s almost impossible for vegans to eat as many calories as we need for good health without getting enough protein.


By contrast, too much protein is the major cause of osteoporosis and contributes to kidney failure and other diseases of affluence. Learn more.

269,Do peer review and animal care and use committees at universities prevent painful or repetitive studies?,"These committees were meant to stop pointless and redundant studies, but most merely rubber stamp animal experiments without question.

"
270,Can plants feel pain?,"The scientific community is just beginning to recognize plants’ advanced capabilities, and we now know that they experience a variety of sensations. 


They can close or open up to avoid an attack or to await rain, for instance. Studies show that plants can feel a touch as light as a caterpillar’s footsteps and send out signals—similar to those sent by the human body—to warn their other leaves to release bad-tasting chemicals in order to deter damaging insects. Studies show that plants also communicate with one another; share medicinal compounds with other plants through their roots, an underground fungal network, and the air; release pheromones; see, hear, smell, and react to dangers in the environment via sensing proteins; pass knowledge on to younger plants; and more.


Just as at one time, many people did not realize that octopuses—whose nervous systems differ significantly from that of humans and other animals—are extremely intelligent and sensitive to pain, it’s possible that plants have intelligence and sentience that humans cannot yet detect. Perhaps one day, we will learn that they have ways of experiencing pain that we have yet to comprehend.


Whether or not that’s the case, there is no need to harm plants unnecessarily. While we must eat in order to survive, we can harm fewer plants by going vegan, because eating plants directly, rather than feeding them to animals and then killing those animals for their flesh, requires far fewer plants and hurts fewer animals who, we already know for sure, feel pain. 


Cows, for example, must consume 16 pounds of vegetation to yield 1 pound of flesh, so by being vegan, we save many more plants’ lives than if we ate meat. And of course, vegans also save nearly 200 animals every year—living, feeling beings who, scientists now know beyond a shadow of a doubt, experience the full range of sensations and emotions, including pain, discomfort, fear, and sadness.


Whether it can be proved that plants experience pain or not, vegan foods are the compassionate choice because they require the deaths of fewer plants and animals.
"
271,Don’t we need to eat meat and dairy products to be healthy?,"No! There is no nutritional need for humans to eat any animal products; all of our dietary needs, even as infants and children, are best supplied by an animal-free diet.


Cows’ milk is suited to the nutritional needs of calves, who, unlike human babies, will double their weight in 47 days (as opposed to 180 days for humans), grow four stomachs, and weigh 1,100-1,200 pounds within two years. Cow’s milk contains about three times as much protein as human milk and almost 50 percent more fat.


The consumption of animal products has been conclusively linked to heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and osteoporosis. Cholesterol (found only in animal products) and animal fat clog arteries, leading to heart attacks and strokes. The rate of many cancers—including colon, breast, cervical, uterine, ovarian, prostate, and lung—is highest in regions where meat consumption is high and lowest where meat-eating is uncommon. A study of more than 25,000 people found that vegetarians have a much lower risk of getting diabetes than meat-eaters. A South African study found not a single case of rheumatoid arthritis in a community of 800 people who ate no meat or dairy products.


There is no physical reason for humans to eat animal products. Cutting animal products from your diet is healthier for you, the animals, and the environment. Learn more about the health benefits of a plant-based diet at PCRM.org.

273,How many vegans are there globally / in the world?,"The total number of vegans, vegetarians, and related categories was estimated to be about 8 per cent of the world population in 2018.


According to ‘The Economist’, in America in 2015, only 3.4 per cent of the population were vegetarian. From that number, only 0.4 per cent were vegans.


A similar survey run in Japan in 2014 shows that 4.7 per cent of the Japanese population is vegetarian, and 2.7 per cent identified as vegan.


Ever since things have changed fast and 2019, according to ‘The Economist’, was ‘The year of the vegan’."
274,What do vegans think of vegetarians?,"I think vegetarians are great! They're reducing animal cruelty and suffering in the world. I'd much rather someone was a vegetarian than a meat eater! They are at least reducing suffering.

Although I'd also encourage them to make the jump to veganism. As an ethical choice however, vegetarianism is conflicted given the immense amount of suffering and death created by the dairy industry."
